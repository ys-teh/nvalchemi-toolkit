Base classes and protocols for molecular dynamics simulations.

This module provides the foundational abstractions for running dynamics
simulations, including hook protocols for extensibility, the base
dynamics class that coordinates model evaluation with integrator updates,
and the ``FusedStage`` class for fusing multiple dynamics stages on a
single GPU with shared batch and forward pass.

Inheritance structure:

.. graphviz::

   digraph dynamics_inheritance {
       rankdir=BT
       fontname="Helvetica"
       node [fontname="Helvetica" fontsize=11 shape=box style="rounded,filled" fillcolor="#dce6f1"]
       edge [fontname="Helvetica" fontsize=10]

       object [label="object" fillcolor="#eeeeee"]
       comm   [label="_CommunicationMixin\n(inter-rank communication)"]
       base   [label="BaseDynamics"]
       fused  [label="FusedStage"]

       comm  -> object [style=bold]
       base  -> comm   [style=bold]
       fused -> base   [style=bold]
   }

``BaseDynamics`` inherits from ``_CommunicationMixin``, so all dynamics
subclasses automatically have communication capabilities for pipeline
execution without needing explicit multiple inheritance.

class BufferConfig(BaseModel):
    """Pre-allocated send/receive buffer capacities for pipeline communication.

    A ``BufferConfig`` declares the maximum size of the ``Batch`` that a
    distributed dynamics stage may exchange with a neighbouring rank. The
    three capacities size the flattened graph tensors independently:
    ``num_systems`` bounds how many graphs fit in the buffer, ``num_nodes``
    bounds the combined atom count across those graphs, and ``num_edges``
    bounds the combined edge count. Because the buffers are fixed-size, they
    must be large enough to hold the biggest batch that will ever cross the
    rank boundary; batches that exceed any capacity cannot be communicated.

    You supply a ``BufferConfig`` when a stage participates in inter-rank
    communication, i.e. it is wired into a :class:`DistributedPipeline` with a
    ``prior_rank`` and/or ``next_rank``. The buffers themselves are created
    lazily via ``Batch.empty()`` on the first simulation step, once a concrete
    batch is available to act as a dtype/device template, so only the capacities
    are needed up front. Set a capacity to ``0`` for a dimension the batch does
    not carry (for example ``num_edges=0`` when edges are recomputed downstream
    rather than communicated).

    Examples
    --------
    Size a buffer for up to four graphs totalling 50 atoms, with no edges
    sent across the boundary::

        from nvalchemi.dynamics.base import BufferConfig

        buffer_cfg = BufferConfig(num_systems=4, num_nodes=50, num_edges=0)

    A buffer that also carries edge connectivity::

        buffer_cfg = BufferConfig(num_systems=10, num_nodes=500, num_edges=2000)

    Notes
    -----
    All three fields are constrained to be ``>= 0``. Choose the capacities from
    the worst-case batch you expect to communicate: undersizing any dimension
    fails at runtime, while oversizing wastes pre-allocated memory.

    This class manages active batch buffers, overflow sinks, and inter-rank
    communication for distributed pipeline execution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prior_rank : int | None
        Rank to receive data from.  ``None`` marks this stage as the
        first in its sub-pipeline (no upstream).  Defaults to ``-1``
        (unset), which tells :meth:`DistributedPipeline.setup` to
        auto-assign based on stage ordering.  Set explicitly to
        ``None`` or a rank integer to prevent auto-assignment.
    next_rank : int | None
        Rank to send graduated samples to.  ``None`` marks this stage
        as the last in its sub-pipeline (no downstream).  Defaults to
        ``-1`` (unset), with the same auto-assignment semantics as
        ``prior_rank``.
    sinks : list[DataSink] | None
        Priority-ordered overflow sinks.
    active_batch : Batch | None
        The currently active working batch.
    max_batch_size : int
        Maximum samples in the active batch.
    done : bool
        Whether this stage has no more work.
    device_type : str
        Device type string (e.g., ``"cuda"``, ``"cpu"``).
    comm_mode : CommMode
        Communication mode for inter-rank buffer synchronization.
        One of ``"sync"``, ``"async_recv"``, or ``"fully_async"``.
        Default ``"sync"``.
    buffer_config : BufferConfig
        Pre-allocation capacities for send/recv communication buffers.
        **Required** when ``prior_rank`` or ``next_rank`` is set to a
        valid rank.  A ``ValueError`` is raised at construction if
        omitted for a stage that has neighbors.
    **kwargs
        Forwarded to the next class in the MRO (cooperative init).

    Attributes
    ----------
    prior_rank : int | None
        Rank of the previous pipeline stage.  ``-1`` means unset
        (will be auto-assigned by :meth:`DistributedPipeline.setup`),
        ``None`` means no upstream, and a non-negative integer is the
        explicit source rank.
    next_rank : int | None
        Rank of the next pipeline stage, with the same conventions
        as ``prior_rank``.
    sinks : list[DataSink]
        Overflow sinks in priority order.
    active_batch : Batch | None
        Current working batch.
    max_batch_size : int
        Maximum active batch capacity.
    done : bool
        Whether this stage is finished.
    sampler : SizeAwareSampler | None
        Size-aware sampler for inflight batching, or ``None`` for
        external batch handling (i.e. the typical looping over
        dataloader approach). Defaults to ``None``.
    refill_frequency : int
        How often to check and refill graduated samples from the
        sampler; no-op if ``sampler`` is not provided.
    device_type : str
        Device type string (e.g., ``"cuda"``, ``"cpu"``).
    comm_mode : CommMode
        Communication mode for inter-rank buffer synchronization.
    buffer_config : BufferConfig | None
        Buffer capacities, or ``None`` for isolated stages.
    _pending_recv_handle : Any
        Stored ``irecv`` handle when receive is deferred (non-sync modes).
        ``None`` when no receive is pending.
    _pending_send_handle : Any
        Stored ``isend`` handle when send is deferred (``"fully_async"``).
        ``None`` when no send is pending.
    _stream : torch.cuda.Stream | None
        The torch CUDA stream created when entering the context manager
        (see :attr:`torch_stream`).  ``None`` when outside a ``with``
        block or on non-CUDA devices.
    _wp_stream : wp.Stream | None
        The warp view of ``_stream`` (see :attr:`warp_stream`).
        ``None`` when outside a ``with`` block or on non-CUDA devices.
    _stream_ctx : contextlib.ExitStack | None
        The active joint stream context entering ``_stream`` on both the

            Rank to receive data from (previous stage). Default None.
        next_rank : int | None, optional
            Rank to send graduated samples to (next stage). Default None.
        sinks : Sequence[DataSink] | None, optional
            Priority-ordered overflow sinks. Default None (empty list).
        active_batch : Batch | None, optional
            The currently active working batch. Default None.
        max_batch_size : int, optional
            Maximum samples in the active batch. Default 100.
        done : bool, optional
            Whether this stage has no more work. Default False.
        sampler : SizeAwareSampler | None, optional
            Size-aware sampler for inflight batching. When provided,
            enables inflight batching where graduated (converged/finished)
            samples are automatically replaced with fresh ones from the dataset.
            Default ``None``, which expects batches to come from dataloaders.
        refill_frequency : int, optional
            How often (in steps) to check for graduated samples and
            request replacements from the sampler. Only used when
            ``sampler`` is not None. Default 1.
        device_type : str, optional
            Device type string (e.g., ``"cuda"``, ``"cpu"``). Defaults
            to ``None``, which will perform auto placement.
        comm_mode : CommMode, optional
            Communication mode controlling blocking behavior of inter-rank
            buffer synchronization.  ``"sync"`` (default) blocks on receive
            immediately.  ``"async_recv"`` defers the receive wait until
            ``_complete_pending_recv`` is called.  ``"fully_async"``
            additionally stores the send handle and drains it at the start
            of the next ``_prestep_sync_buffers`` call.
        buffer_config : BufferConfig | None, optional
            Pre-allocation capacities for send/recv buffers.  Buffers
            are created lazily via ``Batch.empty()`` on the first step
            using the first concrete batch as a template.  **Required**
            when ``prior_rank`` or ``next_rank`` is a valid rank;
            raises ``ValueError`` otherwise.  Default ``None`` (only
            valid for isolated stages with no neighbors).
        debug_mode : bool, optional
            When ``True``, emit detailed ``loguru.debug`` diagnostics
            for inter-rank communication. Default ``False``.

class BaseDynamics(HookRegistryMixin, _CommunicationMixin):
    """Base class for all dynamics simulations.

    This class coordinates a ``BaseModelMixin`` model with a numerical
    integrator to evolve a ``Batch`` of atomic systems over time. It manages
    the step loop, hook execution at stage boundaries, and model evaluation.

    ``BaseDynamics`` inherits from ``HookRegistryMixin`` for hook storage
    and from ``_CommunicationMixin`` for inter-rank communication and
    buffer management for pipeline execution. All dynamics subclasses
    automatically have communication capabilities.

    The public interface centers on three methods. ``run(batch)``
    is the top-level entry point: it repeatedly calls ``step()`` for
    ``n_steps`` iterations and is the only method most users need.
    ``n_steps`` can be set at construction time or passed to ``run()``.
    ``step(batch)`` executes a single simulation step, orchestrating the
    full hook-wrapped sequence ``pre_update → compute → post_update``, with
    hooks fired at each stage boundary, followed by convergence checking.
    Subclasses should generally NOT override ``step``.
    ``compute(batch)`` performs the model forward pass: it calls
    ``model(batch)`` which must return a fully adapted ``ModelOutputs`` dict,
    validates outputs against ``__needs_keys__``, and writes results (forces,
    energies, stresses) back to the batch in-place.
    Subclasses should generally NOT override ``compute``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model : BaseModelMixin
        The neural network potential model.
    step_count : int
        The current step number, starting from 0.
    hooks : list[Hook]
        Flat list of registered hooks.
    model_is_conservative : bool
        Indicates that the model uses automatic differentiation
        to obtain forces.
    convergence_hook : ConvergenceHook
        Hook that evaluates composable convergence criteria.  Defaults
        to a single forces-based criterion with threshold ``0.05``.
    n_steps : int | None
        Total number of simulation steps for ``run()``.  ``None``
        means the step count must be supplied when calling ``run()``.
    exit_status : int
        Status code threshold for graduated samples. Samples with
        ``status >= exit_status`` are treated as no-ops during
        ``step()`` — their positions and velocities are preserved
        through the integrator. Default is 1.
    __needs_keys__ : set[str]
        Set of output keys that this dynamics requires from the model.
        Empty by default on ``BaseDynamics``. Subclasses declare their
        own requirements (e.g., typically forces for optimization and MD).
        Checked in ``_validate_model_outputs()`` after each forward pass.
    __provides_keys__ : set[str]
        Set of keys that this dynamics produces or updates on the batch
        beyond model outputs. Empty by default. Subclasses declare what
        additional state they provide (e.g., ``{"velocities", "positions"}``
        for velocity verlet). Used for validation and buffer preallocation.

    Notes
    -----
    **CUDA streams.** Used as a context manager, dynamics creates a dedicated
    stream shared by torch and warp. This supports overlapping GPU work,
    multi-stage pipelines, and CUDA-graph capture. Entry waits for prior work,
    but exit is asynchronous; synchronize before consuming results on another
    stream.

    Without the context manager (i.e. when you just call `run()` directly),
    dynamics uses the caller's current torch stream and binds warp operations
    to it for each step. Callers using custom streams are responsible for
    cross-stream ordering.

    Developers implementing a new integrator should override
    ``pre_update(batch)`` and ``post_update(batch)`` to implement the
    integration scheme. These are called around ``compute()`` — ``pre_update``
    before, ``post_update`` after. For example, Velocity Verlet updates
    positions in ``pre_update`` and velocities in ``post_update``. The
    class-level sets ``__needs_keys__`` and ``__provides_keys__`` declare
    what outputs the dynamics requires from the model and what additional
    state it produces; requirements are checked in ``_validate_model_outputs()``
    after each forward pass.
    ``FusedStage`` applies masked ``pre_update`` calls before one shared
    ``compute`` call and masked ``post_update`` calls afterward. Models must be
    ``BaseModelMixin`` instances — plain ``nn.Module`` is not accepted.

        Perform the model forward pass to compute forces and energies.

        This method:

        1. Runs the model forward pass, which should enable gradients
        2. Adapts outputs to the standard format
        3. Validates outputs against dynamics requirements
        4. Allocates missing output buffers and writes known keys back to the batch via
           :attr:`_OUTPUT_KEY_TO_BATCH_ATTR`
        5. Detaches all output tensors from the computation graph and
           exposes them as ``_last_outputs`` for custom dynamics subclasses
           that need charges, embeddings, or other non-standard outputs.
        6. Restores the original ``requires_grad`` state of model autograd
           inputs, so downstream hooks can safely perform in-place operations.

        The detach in step 5 is deliberate: model wrappers may return
        tensors that are still attached to the autograd graph (e.g. MACE
        returns energies on the graph even after computing forces
        internally).  Since ``compute()`` is a terminal consumer — values
        have already been copied into the batch — holding the graph would
        cause memory to grow without bound across dynamics steps.  Callers
        that need the live graph (e.g. training loops computing a loss)
        should call ``model(batch)`` directly instead of ``compute()``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        batch : Batch

    migrates converged samples between pipeline stages.

    Wraps one or more :class:`_ConvergenceCriterion` instances and combines
    their results with AND semantics: a sample is converged only when
    **every** criterion is satisfied.

    When ``source_status`` and ``target_status`` are both provided, the
    hook also performs status migration — updating ``batch.status`` for
    converged samples that match ``source_status``.  This enables the
    single-loop execution strategy used by :class:`FusedStage`.

    When used as a standalone convergence detector (both ``source_status``
    and ``target_status`` are ``None``), call :meth:`evaluate` directly
    or let :class:`BaseDynamics` use it via ``_check_convergence``.

    ----------
    criteria : list[_ConvergenceCriterion]

    frequency : int

    stage : DynamicsStage

    source_status : int | None
        Status code of samples to check for convergence.  ``None``

    target_status : int | None

    ``FusedStage`` composes multiple ``BaseDynamics`` sub-stages to share one
    ``Batch`` and one model forward pass per step, avoiding redundant forward
    passes when multiple simulation phases (e.g., relaxation then MD) operate
    on the same batch.

    Unlike ``BaseDynamics``, **``step(batch)``** is overridden. Instead of the
    standard ``pre_update → compute → post_update`` loop, ``FusedStage``
    performs: (1) iterates over sub-stages, applying masked ``pre_update`` on
    each sub-stage's dynamics, (2) a single ``compute()`` call on the full
    batch, then (3) iterates over sub-stages, applying masked ``post_update``.
    Each update applies only to samples whose ``batch.status`` matches that
    sub-stage's status code. Only ONE forward pass happens per step regardless
    of the number of sub-stages. **``run(batch)``** is also overridden —
    the ``n_steps`` attribute (inherited from ``BaseDynamics``) and any
    ``n_steps`` argument passed to ``run()`` are both the **maximum** number
    of steps; the loop runs until all samples have migrated to the
    ``exit_status``, the sampler is exhausted, or ``n_steps`` is reached. Convergence-driven migration is handled
    by ``ConvergenceHook`` instances auto-registered between adjacent
    sub-stages: when samples converge in sub-stage *i*, their ``batch.status``
    is updated to sub-stage *i+1*'s code, causing them to be processed by the
    next dynamics on the following step. The ``+`` operator composes
    sub-stages: ``dyn_a + dyn_b`` creates a ``FusedStage``, and
    ``fused + dyn_c`` appends a third sub-stage. The ``|`` operator (inherited
    from ``BaseDynamics`` via ``_CommunicationMixin``) creates a ``DistributedPipeline``
    for multi-rank execution instead.

    Developers generally do NOT subclass ``FusedStage``. Instead, create
    ``BaseDynamics`` subclasses (integrators) and compose them using ``+``.
    ``FusedStage`` handles orchestration, including masking, automatically. The
    batch must have a ``status`` tensor.

    Hook Firing Semantics
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Because ``FusedStage`` shares a single forward pass across all sub-stages,
    hooks can be registered both on the fused stage and on its sub-stages.
    All step, compute, and integrator update boundaries fire at both levels.
    Fused-stage hooks receive the full batch and overall active mask; sub-stage
    hooks receive the same batch with that sub-stage's status mask.

    The fused stage acts as the outer lifecycle boundary:

    - At shared ``BEFORE_*`` boundaries, fused-stage hooks fire once before
      sub-stage hooks fire in sub-stage order.
    - At shared ``AFTER_*`` boundaries, sub-stage hooks fire in sub-stage order
      before fused-stage hooks fire once.
    - ``ON_CONVERGE`` is sub-stage-only because convergence is evaluated and
      represented independently for each sub-stage.

    Initial force priming uses the same nested ordering for
    ``BEFORE_COMPUTE`` and ``AFTER_COMPUTE``.

    **Step count semantics:** Each sub-stage's ``step_count`` is incremented
    alongside the ``FusedStage``'s own ``step_count`` after every fused step,
    ensuring that hook frequency (e.g., ``every_n_steps``) is respected
    correctly across all sub-stages.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sub_stages : list[tuple[int, BaseDynamics]]
        Ordered ``(status_code, dynamics)`` pairs. Status codes are
        auto-assigned starting from 0 when using the ``+`` operator.
    entry_status : int
        Status code assigned to incoming samples (default: 0).
    exit_status : int
        Status code that triggers graduation to the next pipeline stage.
        Auto-set to ``len(sub_stages)`` (one past the last sub-stage code).
    compile_step : bool
        If ``True``, replace ``self.step`` with
        ``torch.compile(self.step, **compile_kwargs)``.
    compile_kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments forwarded to ``torch.compile``.
    reprime_on_entry : set[int] | None
        Status codes whose newly entering samples skip one update while the
        shared model compute and target-stage compute hooks refresh forces.
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments forwarded to ``BaseDynamics``.

           AFTER_PRE_UPDATE hooks (positions advance to r(t+dt)). Finally,

        """Run the fused stage until all samples converge or the sampler is exhausted.

        Supports two modes of execution:

        **Mode 1 (external batch loop):** When ``batch`` is provided,
        runs the dynamics until ``all_complete`` or until ``n_steps``
        have been executed (whichever comes first).

        **Mode 2 (inflight batching):** When ``batch is None`` and a
        sampler is configured, builds the initial batch from the
        sampler and replaces graduated samples every
        ``refill_frequency`` steps.

        .. note::

            In Mode 2, ``refill_check`` replaces graduated samples by
            extracting remaining graphs via :meth:`Batch.index_select`,
            requesting replacements from the sampler, and appending them
            via :meth:`Batch.append`.  This produces a **new** ``Batch``
            object; the ``batch = result`` reassignment in the loop body
            updates the local reference.  ``None`` is returned when the
            sampler is exhausted and no active samples remain, which
            triggers termination.

        Parameters
        ----------
        batch : Batch | None, optional
            The initial batch. If ``None``, uses the sampler to build one.
        n_steps : int | None, optional
            Maximum number of steps to run.  When ``None``, falls back to
            ``self.n_steps``.  When both are ``None``, the loop runs until
            ``all_complete`` (Mode 1) or sampler exhaustion (Mode 2).
            Sub-stages that have no exit criterion (e.g. a plain MD stage)
            will loop forever without a step limit, so always pass
            ``n_steps`` when such a stage is the final sub-stage.
            Note: sub-stages with ``n_steps`` set use that value as a per-system
            step budget for automatic migration to the next stage.

        -------

    """Orchestrates multi-rank pipeline execution.

    Maps GPU ranks to pipeline stages and coordinates the distributed
    step loop.  Each rank executes only its assigned stage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stages : dict[int, BaseDynamics]
        Mapping from rank to its assigned pipeline stage.
    synchronized : bool
        If ``True``, insert a global ``dist.barrier()`` across **all**
        pipeline ranks after every ``step()`` call, forcing every rank to
        complete its current step before any rank proceeds to the next one.
        This is primarily useful for debugging ordering or deadlock issues
        because it eliminates all inter-rank timing skew.

        .. note::

           This is distinct from the per-stage ``comm_mode`` parameter on
           ``_CommunicationMixin``, which controls the blocking behavior
           of *pairwise* ``isend``/``irecv`` between adjacent stages.
           ``synchronized`` enforces a *global* synchronization point
           across the entire pipeline and will significantly reduce
           throughput; it should be disabled (``False``) in production.

    Attributes
    ----------
    stages : dict[int, BaseDynamics]
        Rank-to-stage mapping.
    synchronized : bool
        Whether a global ``dist.barrier()`` is inserted after every step.
    _dist_initialized : bool
        Whether this DistributedPipeline instance initialized the distributed
        process group (used to determine cleanup responsibility).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Context manager usage (recommended):
    >>> pipeline = DistributedPipeline(stages={0: opt_stage, 1: md_stage})
    >>> with pipeline:

        Parameters

            is the global rank (one rank per stage — the classic streaming
            pipeline). With ``mesh`` the key is the **pipeline index** and each
            rank supplies only its own stage (a :class:`DomainParallel` bound to
            its domain sub-mesh); see ``mesh``.
        synchronized : bool, optional
            If ``True``, insert a global ``dist.barrier()`` across all
            pipeline ranks after every step, preventing any rank from
            advancing until all ranks have completed the current step.
            Useful for debugging but significantly reduces throughput.
            See the class-level docstring for how this differs from the
            per-stage ``comm_mode``.  Default ``False``.
        debug_mode : bool, optional
            When ``True``, emit detailed ``loguru.debug`` diagnostics
            for inter-rank communication and pipeline orchestration.
            Propagated to all stages during ``setup()``. Default ``False``.
        mesh : DeviceMesh, optional
            A 2-D ``(pipeline, domain)`` mesh for **2-D-parallel dynamics**: each
            pipeline index is a *stage-group* — a whole domain sub-mesh row running
            one :class:`DomainParallel` stage. When given, the pipeline resolves
            ``local_stage`` by this rank's pipeline index, sizes completion by the
            number of pipeline stages, and wires each stage's ``prior``/``next`` to
            the adjacent stage-groups' **lead** ranks (domain-rank 0). ``None``
            (default) keeps the classic one-rank-per-stage behavior unchanged.

Diagnostic monitor hooks for long-running simulations.

Provides :class:`EnergyDriftMonitorHook`, which tracks cumulative
energy drift over time and can warn or halt the simulation if the
drift exceeds a configurable threshold.

class EnergyDriftMonitorHook:
    """Track energy drift and warn or stop if it exceeds a threshold.

    In a well-behaved NVE (microcanonical) simulation with a symplectic
    integrator, the total energy should be conserved to within numerical
    precision.  Significant energy drift indicates problems with:

    * The integration timestep (too large for the force magnitudes).
    * The ML potential (non-smooth or discontinuous energy surface).
    * Numerical precision (single vs. double precision accumulation).
    * Force clamping or other hook-induced modifications breaking
      energy conservation.

    This hook monitors the **total energy** (potential + kinetic) over
    the simulation and computes drift metrics.  It supports two modes:

    **Absolute drift mode** (``metric="absolute"``)
        Tracks ``|E(t) - E(0)|``, the absolute deviation from the
        initial total energy.  Suitable for NVE validation runs.

    **Per-atom-per-step drift mode** (``metric="per_atom_per_step"``)
        Tracks ``|E(t) - E(0)| / (N_atoms * step_count)``, a
        normalized metric that allows comparison across systems of
        different size and simulation length.  This is the standard
        metric reported in ML potential benchmarks.

    When the drift exceeds ``threshold``, the hook either emits a
    warning or raises a :class:`RuntimeError`, controlled by the
    ``action`` parameter.

    The hook records the reference energy on the first firing and
    computes drift on all subsequent firings.  For NVT or NPT
    simulations, energy drift is expected (the thermostat/barostat
    injects or removes energy), so use this hook primarily for NVE
    validation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold : float
        Maximum acceptable drift before triggering the ``action``.
        Units depend on ``metric``: eV for ``"absolute"``,
        eV/atom/step for ``"per_atom_per_step"``.
    metric : {"absolute", "per_atom_per_step"}, optional
        Drift metric to use. Default ``"per_atom_per_step"``.
    action : {"warn", "raise"}, optional
        What to do when the threshold is exceeded. ``"warn"`` emits a
        :mod:`loguru` warning; ``"raise"`` raises a
        :class:`RuntimeError`. Default ``"warn"``.
    frequency : int, optional
        Evaluate drift every ``frequency`` steps. Default ``1``.
    include_kinetic : bool, optional
        Whether to include kinetic energy in the total energy
        calculation. Set to ``False`` if only monitoring potential
        energy drift (e.g. for optimizers). Default ``True``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    threshold : float
        Drift threshold.
    metric : str
        Drift metric mode.
    action : str
        Threshold violation behavior.
    include_kinetic : bool
        Whether kinetic energy is included.
    frequency : int
        Evaluation frequency in steps.
    stage : DynamicsStage
        Fixed to ``AFTER_STEP``.

    Examples
    --------
    NVE validation with strict drift tolerance:

    >>> from nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks import EnergyDriftMonitorHook
    >>> hook = EnergyDriftMonitorHook(
    ...     threshold=1e-5,
    ...     metric="per_atom_per_step",
    ...     action="raise",
    ...     frequency=100,
    ... )
    >>> dynamics = DemoDynamics(model=model, n_steps=10_000, dt=0.5, hooks=[hook])
    >>> dynamics.run(batch)

    Soft monitoring during production:

    >>> hook = EnergyDriftMonitorHook(
    ...     threshold=1e-3,
    ...     action="warn",
    ...     frequency=1000,
    ... )

    Notes
    -----
    * The reference energy is captured on the **first** hook firing
      (step 0 by default), not at construction time.  This allows the
      hook to be registered before the batch is available.
    * For batched simulations, drift is computed **per graph** and the
      maximum drift across all graphs is compared to the threshold.
    * Status-filtered and inflight dynamics are not yet supported. Their
      reference energies and elapsed steps must be tracked per system rather
      than by batch position.

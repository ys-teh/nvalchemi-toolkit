    Zarr-backed storage for batched atomic data.

    This sink persists atomic data using the Zarr format, supporting
    both local filesystem and remote/in-memory stores via ``StoreLike``.
    Delegates serialization to :class:`AtomicDataZarrWriter` for
    efficient, amortized I/O with CSR-style pointer arrays.

    Supports any zarr-compatible store: filesystem paths (str or Path),
    zarr Store instances (LocalStore, MemoryStore, FsspecStore for remote
    storage like S3/GCS), StorePath, or dict for in-memory buffers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    store : StoreLike
        Any zarr-compatible store: filesystem path (str or Path), zarr Store
        instance, StorePath, or dict for in-memory buffer storage.
    capacity : int, optional
        Maximum number of samples to store. Default is 1,000,000.
    config : ZarrWriteConfig | Mapping[str, Any] | None
        Compression/chunking configuration for the underlying writer.
        Can be a ``ZarrWriteConfig`` instance or a dict. Default is ``None``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    capacity : int
        Maximum storage capacity.
    store : StoreLike
        The backing zarr store.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> zarr_sink = ZarrData("/path/to/store", capacity=100000)
    >>> zarr_sink.write(batch)
    >>> loaded_batch = zarr_sink.read()

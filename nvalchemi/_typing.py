Type definitions for molecular and crystal graph representations.

For tensors, we use `jaxtyping` to annotate the types,
particularly to note their data type and shapes.

The notation we will use for shapes is as follows:
- B: Batch size
- G: Number of groups in a batch
- V: Number of nodes (vertices)
- E: Number of edges
- H: Hidden feature dimensionality
- A: Number of attributes
- C: Number of centroids
- M: Number of ensemble members
- K: Number of max neighbors
- 3: Number of dimensions for coordinates

The notation for data types is as follows:
- Dimensionalities are assumed to be batch-able; i.e. there are redundant
dimensions for things like charges, spins, and energy. For concatenated
properties like atomic number and masses, they do not have a redundant dimension.
- masses refers to the atomic masses, assumed in amu.
- Coordinates can refer to fractional or Cartesian coordinates.
- Charges can refer to partial or total charges, and can be graph and node level.

class AtomCategory(Enum):
    """
    Categorical mapping for atom classifications within a system.

    This can be used to distinguish between different atoms during
    modeling, such as applying different kinds of constraints to
    them during training or inference (e.g. freezing dynamics for
    surface and bulk atoms).

    This Enum should encompass as many modeling types as possible,
    and is not limited to condensed phase modeling.

    The categories are as follows:
    - GAS: Gas phase atoms.
    - LIQUID: Liquid phase, or solvent atoms.
    - GL_INTERFACE: Gas-liquid interface atoms.
    - SURFACE: Surface atoms.
    - GS_INTERFACE: Gas-surface interface atoms.
    - BULK: Bulk atoms; typically those that can be assumed to be non-interacting.
    - SB_INTERFACE: Solid-bulk interface atoms.
    - FRAGMENT: Fragment atoms
    - CLUSTER: Atoms consituting clusters.
    - TERMINAL: Terminal atoms in molecules.
    - CENTRAL: Central atoms in molecules.
    - SPECIAL: Atoms designated to be generically special.

    While the categories are meant to be mapped to their respective
    chemistries, it would also be valid to just treat the Enum as
    distinct types without the mapping (e.g. 0/1 to differentiate
    between arbitrary types). In the binary case, where you just have
    two atom categories, we recommend using 0/-1, with `SPECIAL` atoms
    being used for your particular operation.

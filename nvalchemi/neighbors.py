"""Neighbor list construction for atomic batches.

Provides :func:`compute_neighbors`, a one-shot function for populating
neighbor data on a :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` outside a dynamics loop.
This is the recommended way to prepare a batch for model evaluation when
you are not running dynamics::

    from nvalchemi.neighbors import compute_neighbors

    batch = Batch.from_data_list([data], device="cuda")
    compute_neighbors(batch, config=model.model_config.neighbor_config)
    out = model(batch)

The :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks.NeighborListHook` uses the same
shared helper (:func:`_write_neighbor_data_to_batch`) internally, so
the neighbor data written to the batch is identical regardless of which
path you use.

    """Compute a neighbor list and write results into *batch* in-place.

    One-shot convenience for populating neighbor data outside a dynamics
    loop.  Equivalent to constructing a
    :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks.NeighborListHook` and invoking it,
    without the staging-buffer or skin-buffer machinery that is only
    useful for repeated dynamics steps.

    After the call, ``batch.neighbor_matrix`` / ``batch.num_neighbors``
    (MATRIX format) or ``batch.neighbor_list`` / ``batch.neighbor_list_shifts``
    (COO format) are populated, and ``batch._neighbor_list_cutoff`` is
    stamped for downstream use by
    :func:`~nvalchemi.models._ops.neighbor_filter.prepare_neighbors_for_model`.

    Pass either *config* (from a model's
    :attr:`~nvalchemi.models.base.ModelConfig.neighbor_config`) or the
    scalar parameters directly.  When *config* is provided, scalar
    parameters are ignored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    batch : Batch
        Batch to populate with neighbor data.
    cutoff : float | None
        Interaction cutoff radius.  Required if *config* is ``None``.
    config : NeighborConfig | None
        Full neighbor configuration (from
        ``model.model_config.neighbor_config``).
    format : NeighborListFormat
        Output format (``MATRIX`` or ``COO``).  Default: ``MATRIX``.
    max_neighbors : int | None
        Maximum neighbors per atom.  Auto-estimated from *cutoff* if
        ``None``.
    half_list : bool
        Whether to build a half neighbor list.  Default: ``False``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If neither *cutoff* nor *config* is provided.

"""Pipeline-based model composition.

:class:`PipelineModelWrapper` organizes models into **groups**, where each
group is a mini-pipeline with its own derivative computation strategy.
The top level sums outputs across groups.

Composition is available via the ``+`` operator for simple additive sums,
or via explicit ``PipelineModelWrapper`` construction for dependent
pipelines and custom derivative computation.

Motivating example — AIMNet2 + Ewald + DFTD3::

    pipe = PipelineModelWrapper(groups=[
        PipelineGroup(
            steps=[
                aimnet2,
                ewald,
            ],
            use_autograd=True,
        ),
        PipelineGroup(steps=[dftd3]),
    ])

See the module docstring or the proposal for full composition examples.

    Only needed when a model's output key doesn't match the downstream
    input key.  For models that don't need renaming, pass the bare model
    directly — the pipeline normalizes it internally.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : BaseModelMixin
        The model to wrap.
    wire : dict[str, str]
        Output-to-attribute rename mapping.  Each entry
        ``{output_key: data_attribute}`` causes the pipeline to write the
        model's ``output_key`` value onto ``data.data_attribute`` before
        downstream models execute.  Downstream models that declare
        ``data_attribute`` in their ``required_inputs`` will then receive
        it automatically.

    Examples
    --------
    AIMNet2 produces ``"charges"`` (per-atom partial charges), but the
    Ewald model expects ``"node_charges"`` as a required input::

        PipelineStep(aimnet2, wire={"charges": "node_charges"})

    After AIMNet2 runs, the pipeline writes its ``"charges"`` output
    onto ``data.node_charges``.  When Ewald runs next, its
    ``adapt_input()`` finds ``data.node_charges`` and uses it.

    If a model's output keys already match downstream input keys, no
    wire mapping is needed — pass the bare model::

    Parameters
    ----------
    steps : list[BaseModelMixin | PipelineStep]
        Ordered list of models (or wrapped models) in this group.
    use_autograd : bool
        If ``True``, sub-models produce energies only; the group sums
        them and calls ``derivative_fn`` to compute forces, stresses,
        and any other requested derivatives from the summed energy.
        If ``False`` (default), each sub-model computes its own outputs
        and the group sums them directly.
    derivative_fn : DerivativeFn | None
        Custom derivative function called after energy summation in
        autograd groups.  Receives ``(energy, data, requested)`` where
        ``energy`` is the summed group energy (on the autograd graph),
        ``data`` is the batch (with ``positions.requires_grad=True``),
        and ``requested`` is the set of output keys that still need to
        be computed (e.g. ``{"forces", "stress"}``).

        When ``None`` (default), the pipeline uses a built-in function
        that computes forces as ``-dE/dr`` and stresses via the affine
        strain trick (see :func:`~nvalchemi.models._utils.prepare_strain`).

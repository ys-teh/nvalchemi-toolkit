"""Training strategy lifecycle and default forward-pass helper.

``TrainingStrategy`` wires one named model (``"main"``) or a dictionary-like
collection of named models through a user-supplied ``training_fn``.
Single-model strategies call ``training_fn(model, batch)``; named-model
strategies call ``training_fn(models, batch)`` for distillation or multi-model
workflows.
Models omitted from optimizer configs are temporarily set to eval mode and
frozen during ``run``. Named-model training functions that use omitted models as
teacher/auxiliary networks must run those forward passes under
``torch.no_grad()`` or detach returned tensors unless autograd through those
outputs is intentionally required.

Loss hooks see live autograd-connected losses from ``AFTER_LOSS`` through
``BEFORE_BACKWARD``. From ``AFTER_BACKWARD`` onward the hook context carries
detached loss tensors so logging hooks do not accidentally retain graphs.

class TrainingStrategy(BaseModel, HookRegistryMixin):
    """Pydantic-driven supervised training loop for MLIP models.

    ``TrainingStrategy`` is the top-level object that owns a supervised
    training run. You construct it declaratively with the models to train,
    the optimizer/scheduler recipe, a duration, a loss, and a forward-pass
    function, then call :meth:`run` with a dataloader to execute the loop.
    Because the strategy is a :class:`pydantic.BaseModel`, construction
    validates the whole configuration up front — mismatched optimizer keys,
    an invalid duration, or an ill-typed ``training_fn`` surface as a
    :class:`pydantic.ValidationError` before any training starts.

    The strategy accepts either a single wrapped model (a
    :class:`~nvalchemi.models.base.BaseModelMixin`), which is stored internally
    under the key ``"main"``, or a ``{name: model}`` mapping for distillation
    and multi-model workflows. That choice drives the ``training_fn`` calling
    convention: single-model strategies call ``training_fn(model, batch)`` and
    named-model strategies call ``training_fn(models, batch)``. Most workflows
    use the provided :func:`default_training_fn`, which runs a forward pass and
    prefixes output keys with ``predicted_`` for loss-target assembly. The
    loss may be a leaf loss (auto-normalized to a one-component
    :class:`~nvalchemi.training.losses.composition.ComposedLossFunction`) or an
    explicit composition such as ``EnergyMSELoss() + ForceMSELoss(...)``.

    ``optimizer_configs`` accepts a single :class:`OptimizerConfig`, a list, or
    a ``{model_name: [OptimizerConfig, ...]}`` mapping; unkeyed forms require a
    single-model input. Keys may target a subset of ``models`` — any model
    without a config is temporarily set to eval mode and frozen during
    :meth:`run`, which is what makes teacher/auxiliary networks in distillation
    work. Named-model training functions that consume those frozen models must
    still run their forward passes under ``torch.no_grad()`` or detach the
    outputs unless autograd through them is intentional.

    Duration is set by exactly one of ``num_epochs`` or ``num_steps`` (both the
    default, or setting both, is rejected). Internally the target is always an
    optimizer-step count; ``num_epochs`` is converted from the dataloader
    length scaled by ``epoch_step_modifier``, so epoch-based runs require a
    sized dataloader. Behavior is customized through ``hooks`` (checkpointing,
    logging, gradient clipping, EMA, DDP, mixed precision, ...) and validation
    is enabled by attaching a :class:`~nvalchemi.training._validation.ValidationConfig`
    via ``validation_config``. Runs are restartable: :meth:`save_checkpoint` and
    :meth:`restore_checkpoint` persist the recipe plus runtime counters, while
    :meth:`to_spec_dict` / :meth:`from_spec_dict` handle JSON-based recipe-only
    save/load.

    Examples
    --------
    Single-model supervised training for a fixed number of epochs:

    >>> import torch  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> from nvalchemi.training import (  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     EnergyMSELoss,
    ...     ForceMSELoss,
    ...     OptimizerConfig,
    ...     TrainingStrategy,
    ...     default_training_fn,
    ... )
    >>> strategy = TrainingStrategy(  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     models=model,
    ...     optimizer_configs=OptimizerConfig(
    ...         optimizer_cls=torch.optim.Adam,
    ...         optimizer_kwargs={"lr": 1e-3},
    ...     ),
    ...     num_epochs=10,
    ...     training_fn=default_training_fn,
    ...     loss_fn=EnergyMSELoss() + ForceMSELoss(normalize_by_atom_count=True),
    ...     devices=[torch.device("cuda")],
    ... )
    >>> strategy.run(train_loader)  # doctest: +SKIP

    Step-based training with periodic validation and a checkpoint hook:

    >>> from nvalchemi.training import ValidationConfig  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> strategy = TrainingStrategy(  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     models=model,
    ...     optimizer_configs=OptimizerConfig(optimizer_cls=torch.optim.AdamW),
    ...     num_steps=50_000,
    ...     training_fn=default_training_fn,
    ...     loss_fn=EnergyMSELoss(),
    ...     validation_config=ValidationConfig(
    ...         validation_data=val_batches,
    ...         every_n_steps=1_000,
    ...     ),
    ...     hooks=[CheckpointHook(checkpoint_dir="runs/exp")],
    ... )
    >>> strategy.run(train_loader)  # doctest: +SKIP

    Named-model (distillation) setup optimizing only the student while the
    teacher stays frozen because it is absent from ``optimizer_configs``:

    >>> strategy = TrainingStrategy(  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     models={"student": student, "teacher": teacher},
    ...     optimizer_configs={
    ...         "student": [OptimizerConfig(optimizer_cls=torch.optim.Adam)]
    ...     },
    ...     num_steps=10_000,
    ...     training_fn=distillation_training_fn,
    ...     loss_fn=EnergyMSELoss(),
    ... )

    Notes
    -----
    Exactly one of ``num_epochs`` and ``num_steps`` must be set; ``num_epochs``
    additionally requires a sized dataloader so it can be converted to a step
    target. Every ``optimizer_configs`` key must name a model present in
    ``models``, and each entry must contain at least one
    :class:`OptimizerConfig`. ``devices`` must have length ``1`` or
    ``len(models)``; named-model :meth:`run` currently supports a single shared
    device only.

    Use :meth:`to_spec_dict` / :meth:`from_spec_dict` for JSON-based save/load.
    Optimizer configs, loss specs, devices, importable training functions, and
    best-effort model specs are serialized. Runtime ``models`` and
    ``training_fn`` overrides passed to :meth:`from_spec_dict` take precedence;
    the serialized model call mode is used only when no runtime model override
    is supplied. ``hooks``, ``step_count``, ``global_step_count``,
    ``batch_count``, ``epoch_count``, and ``epoch_step_count`` remain
    runtime-only.

    Bare :class:`TrainingUpdateHook` instances are auto-wrapped into a single
    :class:`TrainingUpdateOrchestrator` on registration; the orchestrator owns
    the ``zero_gradients`` / ``backward`` / ``optimizer.step`` /
    ``scheduler.step`` calls that the strategy otherwise issues by default.
    Construction-time hook validation errors surface as
    :class:`pydantic.ValidationError`; :meth:`register_hook` raises
    :class:`ValueError` directly.

        Rather than pickling the strategy, this writes a spec-based checkpoint:
        model weights and architecture, optimizer and scheduler state, the
        training counters (``step_count``, ``epoch_count``, ``batch_count``,
        ``global_step_count``), and the state of any
        :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.CheckpointableHook` are each serialized through
        their Pydantic specs, so a restart reconstructs the objects without
        executing arbitrary pickled code. The non-serializable pieces --
        ``training_fn`` and ``loss_target_assembler`` -- are intentionally
        excluded and must be supplied again at load time.

        Checkpoints are indexed within ``root_folder`` and tracked by a
        manifest. ``checkpoint_index=-1`` (the default) auto-increments from the
        latest manifest entry, so repeated calls accumulate ``0, 1, 2, ...``,
        while an explicit index overwrites that slot in place.

        ----------
        root_folder : Path | str
            Root directory for checkpoint files.
        checkpoint_index : int, optional
            Checkpoint index to write. ``-1`` auto-increments from the latest
            manifest index, or starts at ``0`` when no manifest exists.
        save_trainable_state_only : bool, optional
            If ``True``, save optimizer-selected model parameters plus buffers
            and restore model weights non-strictly. Use this only when untrained
            model weights are reproducible from the saved model specs. Set
            ``False`` otherwise.

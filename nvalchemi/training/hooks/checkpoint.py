class CheckpointHook(BaseModel):
    """Periodically save restartable training strategy checkpoints.

    The hook observes completed training counters and saves
    :class:`~nvalchemi.training.strategy.TrainingStrategy` checkpoints through
    the same manifest layout as :func:`nvalchemi.training.save_checkpoint`.
    It fires either every ``step_interval`` completed optimizer steps or every
    ``epoch_interval`` completed epochs. The two cadences are mutually
    exclusive so each hook owns one clear checkpoint policy.

    With ``async_save=True`` (default), the hook first captures an immutable
    CPU snapshot of model, optimizer, scheduler, and strategy metadata on the
    training thread, then writes that snapshot on a single background thread.
    This avoids racing against live training tensors while still moving the
    filesystem work off the critical path. If a later checkpoint is due while
    the previous background write is still running, the hook waits for the
    previous write before capturing the next snapshot so manifest indices stay
    ordered.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If neither interval is provided, or an interval is not positive.
    RuntimeError
        If the hook is called without a strategy workflow in ``TrainContext``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from nvalchemi.training import CheckpointHook, TrainingStrategy
    >>> hook = CheckpointHook("runs/example/checkpoints", step_interval=1000)
    >>> strategy = TrainingStrategy(..., hooks=[hook])  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> strategy.run(train_loader)  # doctest: +SKIP

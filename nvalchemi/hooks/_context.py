    models : dict[str, BaseModelMixin] | ModuleDict | None
        Models participating in the training step; this differs
        from the ``model`` attribute which is intended to
        represent a 'main' model in multi-model workflows. The

    One context instance spans a single
    :meth:`~nvalchemi.gen.generator.AtomisticGenerator.sample` call: the same
    object is dispatched at every
    :class:`~nvalchemi.gen.stages.GenerationStage` and the
    :class:`~nvalchemi.gen.generator.AtomisticGenerator` re-reads it after each
    dispatch, so hooks mutate generation state by *replacing* context fields
    (``ctx.batch = ctx.batch[keep]``), not by editing in place.

    Attributes
    ----------
    batch : Batch | None
        The generated batch on the contract path: set when the generating
        function returns a :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` (``AFTER_GENERATE``
        hooks see it here), ``None`` on the raw path. At call start it holds
        ``inputs`` when they are a :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` (``None``
        otherwise). The raw sample in whatever container the generating
        function produced lives on :attr:`sample`, not here.
    inputs : Any
        The input for the current call: at call start, exactly what was
        passed to :meth:`~nvalchemi.gen.generator.AtomisticGenerator.sample`: a
        tensor container (``Batch``, ``TensorDict``, ...) with text or other
        raw modalities already encoded, or ``None`` for unconditional
        generation. When a condition step is provided for the call, the
        driver runs it between the ``BEFORE_CONDITION`` and
        ``AFTER_CONDITION`` dispatches and stores the conditioned value back
        here, so from ``AFTER_CONDITION`` on this is what the generating
        function is called with; with no condition step it stays the raw
        call input.
    intermediates : dict[str, Any]
        Scratch space for hook-to-hook state within one call (e.g. an
        embedding computed at ``AFTER_CONDITION`` and consumed at
        ``AFTER_GENERATE``).
    step_count : int
        Which generation call this is within a stream; ``0`` for a one-shot
        call. Drives hook frequency gating.
    sample : Any
        The raw sample for this call, set when the generating function
        returns. The driver returns it through the ``Batch`` path when it is
        a :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` (and ``AFTER_GENERATE`` hooks see it
        as ``ctx.batch`` there), as-is otherwise. This is the hot path: the
        sample should be GPU tensors; it may be any structure the function
        emits.
    accepted_mask : torch.Tensor | None
        Boolean acceptance mask written by a hook. The writing hook defines
        which rows it refers to; there is no universal alignment with the
        original call's candidates. ``DeduplicateHook`` aligns its mask with
        the Batch entering that hook and replaces any earlier mask. The
        generation driver does not use this field to filter, stop, or
        resample. ``None`` until a hook records a mask.

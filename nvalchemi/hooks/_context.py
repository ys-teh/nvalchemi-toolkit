    batch : Batch | None
        Current batch being processed. ``None`` is used for lifecycle stages
        that run before the first batch is available.
    model : BaseModelMixin | None
        Model being used (if applicable).
    global_rank : int
        Distributed rank of this process.
    workflow : Any
        Back-reference to the engine running the hooks. ``None`` when
        the workflow does not inject itself.

    converged_mask : Bool[torch.Tensor, "B"] | None
        Boolean mask of samples that converged at the current hook stage.
        ``None`` when convergence has not fired for this dispatch.
    active_graph_mask : Bool[torch.Tensor, "B"] | None
        Boolean mask of shape ``(batch.num_graphs,)`` selecting graphs active in
        the current dynamics dispatch. ``None`` when the dispatch has no status-based
        filtering (typically standalone ``BaseDynamics``). In a ``FusedStage``
        substage, it selects graphs whose status matches that substage.

    Attributes
    ----------
    step_count : int
        Current optimizer step number on this worker.
    global_step_count : int
        Current optimizer step number across all data-parallel workers.
    batch_count : int
        Number of training batches consumed, including batches whose
        optimizer step was skipped by update hooks.
    epoch_step_count : int
        Number of batches consumed within the current training epoch.
    epoch : int
        Current training epoch.
    loss : torch.Tensor | None
        Aggregate loss for the current step.
    losses : dict[str, torch.Tensor] | None
        Named loss components for the current step.
    models : dict[str, BaseModelMixin] | ModuleDict | None
        Models participating in the training step; this differs
        from the ``model`` attribute which is intended to
        represent a 'main' model in multi-model workflows. The
        key/model mapping should be semantic, e.g. 'student' and
        'teacher' in distillation workflows, with 'student' being
        the intended 'main' model.
    optimizers : list[torch.optim.Optimizer]
        Optimizers participating in the training step. Empty when no
        optimizer is attached (e.g. eval-only or manually-driven hook
        contexts); ``TrainingUpdateOrchestrator`` and similar consumers
        treat an empty list as a no-op.
    lr_schedulers : list[torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LRScheduler | None]
        Learning rate schedulers participating in the training step.
        Aligned positionally with ``optimizers`` when populated; entries
        may be ``None`` when an optimizer has no scheduler. Empty when no
        scheduler is attached.
    gradients : dict[str, torch.Tensor] | None
        Parameter gradients for the current step.
    grad_scaler : torch.amp.GradScaler | None
        AMP gradient scaler for mixed-precision training; ``None`` when
        AMP is not in use.
    validation : dict[str, Any] | None
        Latest validation summary produced by the training strategy's
        validation checkpoint (``TrainingStrategy.validate()``).
        ``None`` until validation has run or after the latest summary is
        consumed by metric-driven schedulers. In distributed runs, the reduced
        summary is available on every rank.

Biased potential hooks for enhanced sampling workflows.

Provides :class:`BiasedPotentialHook`, which adds external bias
potentials to the forces and energy computed by the ML model.

class BiasedPotentialHook:
    """Add an external bias potential to forces and energy after the forward pass.

    This hook enables enhanced sampling techniques by composing an
    arbitrary bias potential on top of the ML potential **without**
    modifying the model itself.  The bias is applied in-place to
    ``batch.forces`` and ``batch.energy`` at
    :attr:`~DynamicsStage.AFTER_COMPUTE`, keeping the model output
    pure and the bias fully composable.

    The bias is specified via a callable ``bias_fn`` with signature::

        bias_fn(batch: Batch) -> tuple[Tensor, Tensor]
            Returns (bias_energy, bias_forces) where:
            - bias_energy: Float[Tensor, "B 1"]  — per-graph energy bias
            - bias_forces: Float[Tensor, "V 3"]  — per-atom force bias

    The hook adds the bias terms to the existing batch values::

        batch.energy += bias_energy
        batch.forces += bias_forces

    This design supports a wide range of enhanced sampling methods:

    * **Harmonic restraints** — bias that penalizes deviation from a
      reference geometry (e.g. collective variable restraints).
    * **Umbrella sampling** — harmonic bias along a reaction
      coordinate, with the umbrella window center parameterizing
      ``bias_fn``.
    * **Metadynamics** — time-dependent Gaussian bias deposited along
      collective variables.  ``bias_fn`` would maintain internal state
      (deposited Gaussians) and compute the accumulated bias.
    * **Steered MD** — time-dependent bias that pulls the system along
      a path.  ``bias_fn`` can read ``dynamics.step_count`` to vary
      the bias over time.
    * **Wall potentials** — repulsive bias that confines atoms to a
      region of space (e.g. preventing evaporation from a surface).

    Parameters
    ----------
    bias_fn : Callable[[Batch], tuple[Tensor, Tensor]]
        A callable that computes the bias energy and forces given the
        current batch.  Must return a tuple of
        ``(bias_energy, bias_forces)`` with shapes ``(B, 1)`` and
        ``(V, 3)`` respectively, on the same device as the batch.
    stage : Enum | None, optional
        The stage at which to run this hook. Default is ``None``
        (stage-agnostic until registered with a specific engine).
    frequency : int, optional
        Apply the bias every ``frequency`` steps. Default ``1``
        (every step).
    inplace : bool, optional
        If True, will modify energy and forces in the batch in-place.
        Otherwise, replaces the existing tensors.

    Attributes
    ----------
    bias_fn : Callable
        The bias potential function.
    frequency : int
        Bias application frequency in steps.
    stage : Enum | None
        The stage at which this hook fires.

    Examples
    --------
    Harmonic restraint on center of mass:

    >>> import torch
    >>> from nvalchemi.hooks import BiasedPotentialHook
    >>> def harmonic_restraint(batch):
    ...     # Restrain center of mass to origin with k=10 eV/A^2
    ...     k = 10.0
    ...     com = batch.positions.mean(dim=0, keepdim=True)
    ...     bias_energy = 0.5 * k * (com ** 2).sum().unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0)
    ...     bias_forces = -k * com.expand_as(batch.positions) / batch.num_nodes
    ...     return bias_energy, bias_forces
    >>> hook = BiasedPotentialHook(bias_fn=harmonic_restraint)

    Notes
    -----
    * The ``bias_fn`` is called **after** the model forward pass, so
      it has access to the model-computed forces and energy via the
      batch if needed (e.g. for force-matching penalties).
    * When only some graphs are active, ``bias_fn`` is still called with the
      entire batch and must return energies and forces for the entire batch.
      The hook adds those values only to the active graphs and their atoms,
      while inactive graphs remain unchanged.
    * Because the bias modifies forces in-place, it interacts correctly
      with :class:`MaxForceClampHook` — register the clamp hook
      **after** the bias hook to clamp the total (model + bias) forces.
    * For metadynamics, the ``bias_fn`` closure should hold a reference
      to a mutable state object (e.g. a list of deposited Gaussians)
      that is updated externally or within the callable.
    * The bias does **not** contribute to the autograd graph.  If the
      model uses conservative forces (``forces_via_autograd=True``),
      the bias forces are added after ``torch.autograd.grad`` has
      already computed the model forces.

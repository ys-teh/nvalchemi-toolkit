"""Domain-parallel dynamics wrapper.

Holds a :class:`ShardedBatch` across the step loop and delegates the
per-step model call to a :class:`DistributedModel` — the adapter owns
halo exchange, neighbor-list rebuild, and output consolidation. This
class contributes the orchestration: partition, pre/post-update, atom
migration, and trajectory gather.

# Agent Skills for `nvalchemi`

This folder contains task-focused guides ("skills") for working with the
`nvalchemi` API. Each skill is a plain Markdown file with YAML frontmatter,
readable by any coding agent or human. Claude Code discovers them
automatically inside a clone; other agents reach them through the routing
table in the repository's `AGENTS.md`. To use them outside this repository,
copy the skill folders into your project's or home skills directory.

## Which skill do I need?

| Task | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| Build, batch, or group atomic systems; debug shape, dtype, or device errors | `nvalchemi-data-structures` |
| Write, read, compose, or stream atomic data with the Zarr pipeline | `nvalchemi-data-storage` |
| Tune Dataset/DataLoader throughput or Zarr chunking | `nvalchemi-zarr-perf` |
| Wrap an MLIP or custom PyTorch model for use in nvalchemi | `nvalchemi-model-wrapping` |
| Train a model from scratch, or scale it across GPUs/nodes (DDP) | `nvalchemi-training-api` |
| Adapt a pretrained model to new reference data | `nvalchemi-fine-tuning` |
| Choose, weight, mask, or implement loss functions | `nvalchemi-loss-api` |
| Run MD, relaxation, or EOS scans; compose batched pipelines | `nvalchemi-dynamics-api` |
| Add per-step callbacks (neighbor lists, convergence, logging) | `nvalchemi-dynamics-hooks` |
| Implement a new integrator, optimizer, or sampler class | `nvalchemi-dynamics-implementation` |
| Add progress dashboards, TensorBoard, or CSV observability | `nvalchemi-reporting` |

Each skill lives at `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

## How the skills relate

Skills build on each other in a few short chains; read upstream skills first
when you are new to an area:

```text
data-structures -> data-storage -> zarr-perf
model-wrapping + loss-api -> training-api -> fine-tuning
dynamics-hooks -> dynamics-api | dynamics-implementation
reporting (orthogonal: attaches to training and dynamics)
```

## Authoring conventions

Follow these rules when adding or editing a skill.

### Frontmatter

Exactly two YAML fields — no agent-specific fields (such as
`allowed-tools`), so the skills stay portable across agent platforms:

- `name`: must equal the directory name; lowercase words joined by
  hyphens, prefixed `nvalchemi-`.
- `description`: a `>-` folded scalar, at most ~500 characters. The first
  sentence states what the skill teaches; it must also contain a
  "Use when ..." clause listing concrete task triggers, so agents can route
  without opening the file.

### Structure

- One H1 title after the frontmatter.
- `## Overview` comes first: what the skill covers, why, and pointers to
  the deeper `docs/userguide/` pages.
- Then task-oriented H2 sections in workflow order.
- `## Key files` (optional) goes last.

### Content rules

- Keep the whole skill in one `SKILL.md` (200–550 lines). No side files:
  single-file skills stay portable and are read in full by every agent.
- Code examples must be runnable against the current API: every import,
  class, function, and argument must exist in the source tree. Verify
  before committing.
- Every repository path mentioned must exist.
- Wrap prose and code at 88 characters (markdownlint MD013 applies to code
  blocks; tables are exempt).
- Cross-reference sibling skills by backticked name; reference repository
  files by their path from the repo root.

### When adding a skill

Update all three indexes:

1. The routing table in this README.
2. The skill routing table in `AGENTS.md`.
3. The table in `docs/userguide/agent_skills.md`.

Then run `uv run pre-commit run markdownlint -a` (note: `make lint` does
not run markdownlint) and verify the frontmatter parses as YAML.

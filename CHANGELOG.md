# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- MACE training example for end-to-end model training workflows.
- `EMAHook._build_averaged_model` override seam, so a caller that owns
  model sharding can supply a pre-built `AveragedModel` instead of the
  default deepcopy — enabling EMA on `fully_shard` (FSDP2) / DTensor
  models. Default behaviour unchanged.
- Checkpointable training hooks. Hooks such as EMA can now save restart
  state with strategy checkpoints, so resumed training keeps averaged
  weights instead of starting them over.
- Training strategy checkpoint restart support, including a periodic
  checkpoint hook for step- or epoch-based saves and restart loading with
  models, optimizers, schedulers, runtime counters, and restart-safe device
  placement.
- PhysicsNeMo-compatible atomic datapipes with `MultiDataset` composition,
  multidataset-aware sampling policies, and fused batch loading that preserves
  the Zarr reader's coalesced I/O path.
- First-class validation on `TrainingStrategy`. Set a `ValidationConfig`
  on `strategy.validation_config` and validation runs automatically at the
  configured step or epoch cadence, plus one final pass at end-of-training;
  the latest summary is stored on `strategy.last_validation`. Mechanics live
  in a public, context-managed `ValidationLoop` that can also be run
  standalone outside training. An `inference_model` slot lets EMA (or SWA /
  a distillation teacher) publish averaged weights for validation to read.
  A new `AFTER_VALIDATION` hook stage fires immediately after each pass so
  loggers can read the live summary. For per-batch logging, pass a
  `batch_callback` (any object matching the `BatchValidationCallback`
  protocol) on the config; it is invoked once per validation batch with the
  batch, predictions, and per-batch loss.
- Metric-driven learning-rate schedulers. `ReduceLROnPlateau` is now
  supported via `OptimizerConfig.scheduler_metric_adapter` (a summary-dict
  key string or a callable). Time-based schedulers step every optimizer
  step as before; metric-driven schedulers step only at validation
  checkpoints, where the validation summary supplies the metric.

### Core Data Layer

- **In-memory datapipes** - new `InMemoryDataset` stores a fully materialized
  `Batch` in memory and serves graph-indexed `Batch` selections through the
  same `load_batches` / fused-prefetch interface used by `DataLoader`. It can
  be constructed from an existing `Batch` or materialized from a reader in
  chunks, with optional field-level metadata and batch transforms.
- **User-specified transforms** - `Dataset` accepts a `transforms=` kwarg
  (per-sample `(AtomicData, metadata) -> (AtomicData, metadata)`) and
  `DataLoader` accepts a `batch_transforms=` kwarg (per-batch `Batch -> Batch`).
  Both default to `None` (backward compatible). New `nvalchemi.data.transforms`
  subpackage exposes a polymorphic `Compose` utility plus `SampleTransform`
  and `BatchTransform` type aliases, re-exported from `nvalchemi.data`.
  Per-sample transforms run after device transfer on both sync and prefetch
  paths; per-batch transforms run on the consumer thread after `Batch.from_data_list`.
  Transform failures are wrapped in `RuntimeError` with `transform[<i>]`
  breadcrumb and `__cause__` preserved.

### Models

- **UMA (fairchem-core) wrapper** — new `UMAWrapper` exposes UMA
  (Universal Models for Atoms) foundation models (`uma-s-1p1`,
  `uma-s-1p2`, `uma-m-1p1`) through the `BaseModelMixin` interface,
  ready for any dynamics engine or standalone inference. UMA is
  multi-task; the wrapper is pinned to one head at construction (OMol,
  OMat, OC20, ODAC, OMC). Input conversion is tensor-native (no ASE
  round trip); energy is the differentiable primitive with forces and
  (for periodic tasks) stress from autograd. Install via the new `uma`
  optional extra (`pip install 'nvalchemi-toolkit[uma]'`), which is
  declared conflicting with the `mace` and `cu12`/`cu13` extras
  (incompatible `e3nn` / `torch` pins) and resolves into its own
  environment. `from_checkpoint` forwards fairchem's `inference_settings`
  (including `"turbo"` for `torch.compile`). See the
  `examples/advanced/09_uma_nve.py` NVE/NVT/NPT walkthrough.

### Fixed

- **Zarr dataloader custom fields** — validated `Dataset` batch paths now
  preserve reader field-level metadata so custom atom-, edge-, and
  system-level tensors survive batching like the `skip_validation` path.
- EMA checkpointing now restores averaged tensors to the corresponding live
  model tensor devices, publishes restored EMA weights during SETUP before validation,
  and supports callable reconstruction specs for model wrappers that must
  rebuild from factory methods, including MACE checkpoints with
  cuEquivariance enabled.
- **NVT Nosé-Hoover velocity collapse** (#104) — reset the NHC
  `total_scale` scratch accumulator to the multiplicative identity on
  each chain update, preventing persistent state from zeroing or
  compounding velocity rescaling.
- **MTK NPT barostat runaway** (#89, #90) — four bugs in
  `nvalchemi/dynamics/integrators/npt.py` (with matching fixes in
  `nph.py`) that combined to drive unbounded cell-volume drift in long
  NPT runs. Cross-validated against ASE `MTKNPT`/`IsotropicMTKNPT` and
  TorchSim `npt_nose_hoover_isotropic`. Isotropic users will see their
  barostat mass `W` shrink by 3× (now matches canonical MTK).
- **Ewald / PME energies buffer leak** (#82) — in-place `scatter_add_`
  of gradient-carrying `per_atom_energies` chained each forward's Warp
  backward tape onto `_energies_buf`, causing linear per-step slowdown
  and unbounded GPU memory growth. `detach_()` the buffer after each
  forward.

### Deprecated

- `cells_inv` argument on `_cell_kinetic_energy`. Cell kinetic energy
  is computed directly from the strain rate `ε̇` and no longer needs
  the cell inverse. The argument is retained for backwards
  compatibility (a `DeprecationWarning` is emitted when passed) and
  will be removed in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

- Dataset-level explicit batch reads now use `load_batches(...)`. The raw
  `read_many(...)` API remains on readers, where storage backends can optimize
  ordered I/O, but `Dataset.read_many(...)` and `Dataset.get_batch(...)` have
  been removed to keep the public Dataset API focused on sample access,
  batch materialization, and prefetching.
- Split hook context state into `HookContext`, `DynamicsContext`, and
  `TrainContext` so each workflow exposes only the fields it owns.
  Dynamics-specific state such as `step_count`, `converged_mask`, and
  `global_rank` now lives on `DynamicsContext`, while training state lives on
  `TrainContext`. Existing hooks that used `HookContext` for dynamics-only
  fields should update their annotations to `DynamicsContext`.
- Standardized public `stress` outputs on tensile-positive Cauchy stress
  (`sigma = -W / V`) while keeping low-level virials defined as negative
  strain derivatives.
- Removed `EvaluateHook` in favor of first-class validation on
  `TrainingStrategy`. Validation is no longer a registered hook. Migrate by
  moving the hook's arguments onto a `ValidationConfig`:

  ```python
  # Before
  strategy.register_hook(
      EvaluateHook(validation_data=val_data, every_n_epochs=1)
  )

  # After
  strategy.validation_config = ValidationConfig(
      validation_data=val_data, every_n_epochs=1
  )
  ```

   Validation then runs automatically during `strategy.run(...)` at the
   configured cadence and once at end-of-training. The `EvaluationSink` /
   `EvaluationZarrSink` output classes were removed; replace summary logging
   with an `AFTER_VALIDATION` hook and per-batch logging with a
   `ValidationConfig(batch_callback=...)`.

# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Add support for PEFT fine-tuning within `FineTuningStrategy`, including
  LoRA workflows with `LoRAConfig`, `load_peft_checkpoint_into_model`,
  and base-model fingerprint checks for PEFT checkpoint loading.
- Add `DynamicsStage.ON_ADMISSION` to `BaseDynamics`, enabling hooks to
  initialize per-system state once when a batch is admitted, before force
  priming and outside compiled fused steps.
- `FusedStage(reprime_on_entry=...)` — status codes whose newly entering
  graphs skip one integrator update so the shared compute and target-stage
  `AFTER_COMPUTE` hooks can refresh forces under the new stage's context
  before it advances them.
- **Batched nudged elastic band (NEB) workflows** — the new
  `nvalchemi.dynamics.paths` API provides grouped-path validation, endpoint
  interpolation, and IDPP initialization, together with a GPU-first `NEB`
  engine for regular and climbing-image optimization. It supports
  improved-tangent forces, fixed or relaxed endpoints, per-path fixed atoms,
  optional neighbor-list hooks, compiled fused steps, and diagnostics for
  force maxima, barriers, path lengths, and highest-energy images. The
  `examples/advanced/16_batched_neb.py` walkthrough demonstrates optimizing
  multiple reaction paths concurrently.

### Fixed

- **Dynamics hook lifecycle** — fused-level hooks now fire at the
  `BEFORE_PRE_UPDATE`, `AFTER_PRE_UPDATE`, `BEFORE_POST_UPDATE`, and
  `AFTER_POST_UPDATE` boundaries, and sub-stage `BEFORE_COMPUTE` hooks now
  fire. Fused-level `AFTER_COMPUTE` hooks now run after the sub-stage loop
  instead of before it. Existing workarounds that register the same hook at
  both fused and sub-stage levels will therefore invoke it twice at each
  matching boundary and should remove the duplicate registration.
- **`FusedStage` force priming** — a dynamics instance's own adaptive
  optimizer state (e.g. FIRE's per-graph `dt`/`alpha`/step counters in
  `self._state`) is now preserved across masked `pre_update`/`post_update` calls.

### Deprecated

- `FusedStage.register_fused_hook()`. Use the inherited `register_hook()`
  method instead; hooks on a `FusedStage` already observe the complete fused
  batch.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-07

### Added

- Domain decomposition for distributed inference and dynamics: a spatial halo
  strategy and a graph-parallel strategy, both driven by a declarative
  `MLIPSpec` a model wrapper publishes as `distribution_spec`. Ewald, PME,
  MACE, AIMNet2 and UMA ship specs; composed pipelines decompose per stage.
  Energy, forces and stress agree with a single-GPU reference to fp32 rounding
  under both strategies, eager and compiled. `nvalchemi.distributed.pin_fp32`
  pins full-precision fp32 for runs that must match a reference, since TF32
  makes distributed and single-process results diverge well beyond fp32 noise.

- MACE training example for end-to-end model training workflows.
- `EMAHook._build_averaged_model` override seam, so a caller that owns
  model sharding can supply a pre-built `AveragedModel` instead of the
  default deepcopy — enabling EMA on `fully_shard` (FSDP2) / DTensor
  models. Default behaviour unchanged.
- Checkpointable training hooks. Hooks such as EMA can now save restart
  state with strategy checkpoints, so resumed training keeps averaged
  weights instead of starting them over.
- Training strategy checkpoint restart support, including a periodic
  checkpoint hook for step- or epoch-based saves and restart loading with
  models, optimizers, schedulers, runtime counters, and restart-safe device
  placement.
- PhysicsNeMo-compatible atomic datapipes with `MultiDataset` composition,
  multidataset-aware sampling policies, and fused batch loading that preserves
  the Zarr reader's coalesced I/O path.
- First-class validation on `TrainingStrategy`. Set a `ValidationConfig`
  on `strategy.validation_config` and validation runs automatically at the
  configured step or epoch cadence, plus one final pass at end-of-training;
  the latest summary is stored on `strategy.last_validation`. Mechanics live
  in a public, context-managed `ValidationLoop` that can also be run
  standalone outside training. An `inference_model` slot lets EMA (or SWA /
  a distillation teacher) publish averaged weights for validation to read.
  A new `AFTER_VALIDATION` hook stage fires immediately after each pass so
  loggers can read the live summary. For per-batch logging, pass a
  `batch_callback` (any object matching the `BatchValidationCallback`
  protocol) on the config; it is invoked once per validation batch with the
  batch, predictions, and per-batch loss.
- Metric-driven learning-rate schedulers. `ReduceLROnPlateau` is now
  supported via `OptimizerConfig.scheduler_metric_adapter` (a summary-dict
  key string or a callable). Time-based schedulers step every optimizer
  step as before; metric-driven schedulers step only at validation
  checkpoints, where the validation summary supplies the metric.

- Python 3.14 support across the core package and the cu12/cu13 CUDA extras,
  including pure-`pip` installs: `requires-python` is now `>=3.11,<3.15`.
  Python 3.15 is not publicly supported yet (upstream wheels missing).
- numpy relaxed to `>=2,<3` — downstream users may use any numpy 2.x.

### Model Wrappers

- **Pipeline neighbor-list adaptation policy** — `PipelineModelWrapper`
  now accepts `neighbor_adaptation` (`"auto"`, `"always"`, `"never"`) and
  `max_cutoff_ratio` (default `1.5`). The default `"auto"` mode only filters
  a source neighbor list for a smaller cutoff when the source cutoff is at most
  `max_cutoff_ratio` times the target cutoff; larger gaps get separate source
  lists. `"always"` builds one max-cutoff source list, while `"never"` builds
  exact cutoff source groups and skips cutoff filtering.

### Core Data Layer

- **Extensible batch levels** - `LevelSchema` and `Batch` now support custom
  uniform, segmented, and ordered product levels. Custom definitions,
  fields, and product-derived cardinalities are preserved through construction,
  reconstruction, selection, append, reusable buffers, point-to-point transport,
  and Zarr persistence. Pointer-only levels remain available in direct `Batch` and
  Zarr storage workflows. Existing atom, edge, and system APIs remain compatible,
  and legacy-only Zarr stores retain their existing layout.
- **In-memory datapipes** - new `InMemoryDataset` stores a fully materialized
  `Batch` in memory and serves graph-indexed `Batch` selections through the
  same `load_batches` / fused-prefetch interface used by `DataLoader`. It can
  be constructed from an existing `Batch` or materialized from a reader in
  chunks, with optional field-level metadata and batch transforms.
- **User-specified transforms** - `Dataset` accepts a `transforms=` kwarg
  (per-sample `(AtomicData, metadata) -> (AtomicData, metadata)`) and
  `DataLoader` accepts a `batch_transforms=` kwarg (per-batch `Batch -> Batch`).
  Both default to `None` (backward compatible). New `nvalchemi.data.transforms`
  subpackage exposes a polymorphic `Compose` utility plus `SampleTransform`
  and `BatchTransform` type aliases, re-exported from `nvalchemi.data`.
  Per-sample transforms run after device transfer on both sync and prefetch
  paths; per-batch transforms run on the consumer thread after `Batch.from_data_list`.
  Transform failures are wrapped in `RuntimeError` with `transform[<i>]`
  breadcrumb and `__cause__` preserved.

### Models

- **UMA (fairchem-core) wrapper** — new `UMAWrapper` exposes UMA
  (Universal Models for Atoms) foundation models (`uma-s-1p1`,
  `uma-s-1p2`, `uma-m-1p1`) through the `BaseModelMixin` interface,
  ready for any dynamics engine or standalone inference. UMA is
  multi-task; the wrapper is pinned to one head at construction (OMol,
  OMat, OC20, ODAC, OMC). Input conversion is tensor-native (no ASE
  round trip); energy is the differentiable primitive with forces and
  (for periodic tasks) stress from autograd. Install via the new `uma`
  optional CUDA variants (`pip install 'nvalchemi-toolkit[uma-cu12]'` or
  `nvalchemi-toolkit[uma-cu13]`), which remain incompatible with `mace` because
  of their `e3nn` pins. `from_checkpoint` forwards fairchem's `inference_settings`,
  including the compiled `"default"` and `"turbo"` presets and the eager
  `"batch"` preset. See the
  `examples/advanced/09_uma_nve.py` NVE/NVT/NPT walkthrough.

### Fixed

- Cap `plotext<6`: plotext 6 removed `clf()`, which hooks/reporting and the
  training CLI call; fresh resolves were silently installing 6.x and breaking
  Rich dashboards and `nvalchemi-training` on all Python versions.

- **UMA CUDA dependency resolution** — add standalone `uma-cu12` and
  `uma-cu13` extras. They select the matching torch build without installing
  PhysicsNeMo's RAPIDS extras, whose numba upper bound conflicts with Fairchem
  2.22.

- **Segment expansion on a non-default GPU** — the Warp expansion kernel behind
  `Batch.index_select` was launched against whichever CUDA device happened to be
  current, so a batch whose storage records a bare `cuda` while its tensors live
  on another GPU read unmapped memory (`an illegal memory access was
  encountered`) on every host where the current device is not `cuda:0`, and the
  launch left that device selected for the rest of the process. The kernel now
  launches on the device the batch pointer lives on and restores the caller's
  current device.
- **Level storages recorded an unresolved device** — `to_device("cuda")` and
  construction with `device="cuda"` stored the bare request while the tensors
  landed on whichever GPU was current, so the storage's `device` disagreed with
  its own data as soon as the current device changed and later pointer builds
  and concatenations raised `Expected all tensors to be on the same device`. A
  bare `cuda` is now resolved to the current device at the moment it is
  recorded. A `Batch` built around a storage takes that storage's device rather
  than resolving the request on its own, so `Batch(storage=..., device="cuda")`
  no longer reports the current GPU while its data sits on another one; an
  indexed device that contradicts the storage raises `ValueError`. A batch that
  allocates its own storage builds it on the requested device too, so
  `Batch(device="cuda:1")` no longer records `cuda:1` while every tensor
  assigned to it lands on CPU.
- **Merging batches held on different devices** — the bulk merge behind
  `MultiLevelStorage.from_batches` and `MultiLevelStorage.concatenate` moved
  every contributed tensor to the merge device except `segment_lengths`, which
  it read where each group already held them, so folding a CPU storage into a
  CUDA one raised `Expected all tensors to be on the same device` out of
  `torch.cat`. The segment lengths are now moved like everything else.
- **Low-precision graph-balanced losses** — `per_graph_sum` accumulated in the
  input dtype, and CUDA scatter atomics round after every add, so a bf16 running
  sum stopped growing at 256 and an fp16 one at 2048. A per-atom-normalized
  force loss over 3000 atoms was wrong by a factor of 3.6 in bf16 and 10% in
  fp16. Sums now accumulate in at least fp32 and are returned in fp32 for
  half-precision inputs — on the padded `(B, V_max, 3)` force layout as well
  as the dense `(V, 3)` one — so a per-graph total past the fp16 ceiling of
  65504 no longer saturates to `inf` before the loss normalizes it, and a
  half-precision force loss returns the same fp32 value whichever layout it is
  given; fp32 and fp64 results are unchanged. The dense graph-balanced path sums
  each atom's three Cartesian components in fp32 too, so a single fp16 residual
  large enough to overflow that inner sum (components near 150) no longer makes
  the dense loss `inf` where the padded loss is finite.
- **Demo model embeddings on a batch** — `DemoModelWrapper.compute_embeddings`
  set `node_embeddings` as a plain attribute, which a `Batch` routes to its
  system group, so the per-atom tensor failed the batch-size check and the call
  raised on every batch. Node embeddings are now written through
  `Batch.add_key(..., level="node")`, which registers the field with the
  storage's attribute map so a later plain `batch.node_embeddings = ...` routes
  back to the atoms group instead of the system group. `MACEWrapper` writes its
  node embeddings through the same path. The graph embeddings the same call
  returns were also pooled with an unexpanded `(N, 1)` scatter index, which
  `scatter_add_` does not broadcast over an `(N, H)` source, so every feature
  but the first came back zero; the index is now expanded and all `H` features
  are summed.
- **Segfault on a cross-device buffer write** — `Batch.put` and the
  `GPUBuffer.write` that calls it took the Warp launch device for their fit-mask
  kernel from the *source* batch, so writing a CPU batch into a CUDA buffer ran
  the kernel on the host against CUDA destination pointers and killed the
  process with a segmentation fault rather than raising. `GPUBuffer.write` now
  moves an incoming batch to the buffer's device, as `HostMemory.write` already
  moves its items to CPU; `Batch.put` raises `ValueError` on a source held
  elsewhere; and the put kernels launch on the destination and refuse a
  mixed-device pair.
- **Attribute writes routed past their own group** — a tensor assigned to a
  `Batch` resolved its level through the attribute map alone, so any key the map
  did not know about went to the system group even when the batch already held
  it at node or edge level, leaving the same name at two levels and breaking the
  next `to_data_list()`. A write now follows the group that already holds the
  key, and `Batch.add_key` registers what it adds.
- **Half-precision totals in the default loss reduction** — the validity-weighted
  mean every loss leaf inherits from `BaseLossFunction.reduce` summed in the
  residual's dtype, so a finite per-graph fp16 residual saturated the moment its
  total passed 65504: an `EnergyMSELoss` over 64 graphs with a 40 eV residual
  returned `inf`. Both sums now accumulate in at least fp32 and a half-precision
  input returns an fp32 loss, as the force terms already did; fp32 and fp64 are
  bit-identical.
- **Validation summaries over half-precision losses** — the validation loss
  accumulator kept its running sums in the loss's own dtype and widened only
  when the summary was built, so a bf16 running sum stopped growing once each
  batch's contribution fell below half an ulp: 500 batches averaging 0.8
  reported 0.512, 36% low (fp16: 0.75% low). Every running sum is now widened to
  float64 as it is taken.
- **`TrainingStrategy.validate()` before `run()`** — models were moved to
  `devices` only by `run()` and the checkpoint restore path, so a standalone
  validation pass on a CUDA strategy fed GPU batches to CPU models and failed
  with `Expected all tensors to be on the same device`. `validate()` now makes
  the same (idempotent) move, and places a published `inference_model` the same
  way, so an EMA slot filled before `devices` changed no longer meets batches on
  a device it was never moved to.
- **Checkpoint resume across devices** — a live restore loaded weights and
  optimizer state onto the device recorded in the checkpoint rather than the one
  the live strategy runs on, and `run()` reused resumed optimizer state without
  following the models it had just moved. Resuming a `cuda:0` checkpoint on
  another GPU, or on a rank a `DDPHook` re-pins, died in the first optimizer
  step with `Expected all tensors to be on the same device`. Live restores now
  target the live device, and the new
  `nvalchemi.training.rehome_optimizer_state` helper (applied automatically
  whenever a resumed optimizer is reused, by `run()` and by `train_batch()`)
  moves resumed state onto its parameters, including tensors a custom optimizer
  nests inside dicts, lists, or tuples. On that path `map_location` only stages
  the load — the live strategy's `devices` still decide where the restored
  objects come to rest — so the returned `strategy_metadata` now reports the
  strategy's devices instead of the raw `map_location`, which could name a
  device none of the restored models were on.
- **Ewald charge gradients and cell derivatives** — the reciprocal term was only
  ever differentiated with respect to positions and charges, so a non-hybrid
  Ewald returned a wrong `dE/dq`, and strain-autograd through the detached
  Green's function gave a wrong stress. Work needing a cell derivative now
  routes to the staged reciprocal.
- **Ewald / PME strain cache** — cached k-vectors were rebuilt from the strained
  cell, so a second stress evaluation reused the first call's autograd graph.

- **Distributed dynamics lifecycle** — keep per-system integrator state aligned
  when pipeline receives and graduates systems, clear reusable communication
  buffers before every send without shrinking their segmented capacity, and run
  distributed stages with explicit per-system step budgets and optional early
  convergence.
- **Zarr dataloader custom fields** — validated `Dataset` batch paths now
  preserve reader field-level metadata so custom atom-, edge-, and
  system-level tensors survive batching like the `skip_validation` path.
- EMA checkpointing now restores averaged tensors to the corresponding live
  model tensor devices, publishes restored EMA weights during SETUP before validation,
  and supports callable reconstruction specs for model wrappers that must
  rebuild from factory methods, including MACE checkpoints with
  cuEquivariance enabled.
- **NVT Nosé-Hoover velocity collapse** (#104) — reset the NHC
  `total_scale` scratch accumulator to the multiplicative identity on
  each chain update, preventing persistent state from zeroing or
  compounding velocity rescaling.
- **MTK NPT barostat runaway** (#89, #90) — four bugs in
  `nvalchemi/dynamics/integrators/npt.py` (with matching fixes in
  `nph.py`) that combined to drive unbounded cell-volume drift in long
  NPT runs. Cross-validated against ASE `MTKNPT`/`IsotropicMTKNPT` and
  TorchSim `npt_nose_hoover_isotropic`. Isotropic users will see their
  barostat mass `W` shrink by 3× (now matches canonical MTK).
- **Ewald / PME energies buffer leak** (#82) — in-place `scatter_add_`
  of gradient-carrying `per_atom_energies` chained each forward's Warp
  backward tape onto `_energies_buf`, causing linear per-step slowdown
  and unbounded GPU memory growth. `detach_()` the buffer after each
  forward.
- **FusedStage graduation not reported** — `FusedStage.step()` returned
  `exit_converged=None` for samples graduated via a sub-stage's `n_steps`
  counter or its `ConvergenceHook`, so consumers of the returned indices
  (e.g. `DistributedPipeline`) silently dropped such samples.

### Deprecated

- `cells_inv` argument on `_cell_kinetic_energy`. Cell kinetic energy
  is computed directly from the strain rate `ε̇` and no longer needs
  the cell inverse. The argument is retained for backwards
  compatibility (a `DeprecationWarning` is emitted when passed) and
  will be removed in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

- The `cu12`/`cu13` extras no longer install the RAPIDS stack (`cuml`, `cupy`,
  `pylibraft`, NVIDIA DALI) or PhysicsNeMo's CUDA extras — they now provide the
  CUDA torch build, `nvalchemi-toolkit-ops`, `cuequivariance-ops-torch`, and
  PhysicsNeMo core. Nothing in `nvalchemi` imports the RAPIDS stack, and this
  removes upstream pins that made `pip install nvalchemi-toolkit[cu12]`
  unresolvable on Python 3.14. Users needing RAPIDS should install it
  directly (`cuml-cuXX`, `cupy-cuda1Xx`).

- `EwaldModelWrapper` and `PMEModelWrapper` now default to `hybrid_forces=False`.
  The analytic direct-output path (`hybrid_forces=True`) does not produce
  consistent gradients and is not supported under domain decomposition, where
  `distribution_spec` rejects it. Forces and stress now come from autograd over
  the energy; pass `hybrid_forces=True` explicitly to keep the old path.

- Dataset-level explicit batch reads now use `load_batches(...)`. The raw
  `read_many(...)` API remains on readers, where storage backends can optimize
  ordered I/O, but `Dataset.read_many(...)` and `Dataset.get_batch(...)` have
  been removed to keep the public Dataset API focused on sample access,
  batch materialization, and prefetching.
- Split hook context state into `HookContext`, `DynamicsContext`, and
  `TrainContext` so each workflow exposes only the fields it owns.
  Dynamics-specific state such as `step_count`, `converged_mask`, and
  `global_rank` now lives on `DynamicsContext`, while training state lives on
  `TrainContext`. Existing hooks that used `HookContext` for dynamics-only
  fields should update their annotations to `DynamicsContext`.
- Standardized public `stress` outputs on tensile-positive Cauchy stress
  (`sigma = -W / V`) while keeping low-level virials defined as negative
  strain derivatives.
- Removed `EvaluateHook` in favor of first-class validation on
  `TrainingStrategy`. Validation is no longer a registered hook. Migrate by
  moving the hook's arguments onto a `ValidationConfig`:

  ```python
  # Before
  strategy.register_hook(
      EvaluateHook(validation_data=val_data, every_n_epochs=1)
  )

  # After
  strategy.validation_config = ValidationConfig(
      validation_data=val_data, every_n_epochs=1
  )
  ```

   Validation then runs automatically during `strategy.run(...)` at the
   configured cadence and once at end-of-training. The `EvaluationSink` /
   `EvaluationZarrSink` output classes were removed; replace summary logging
   with an `AFTER_VALIDATION` hook and per-batch logging with a
   `ValidationConfig(batch_callback=...)`.

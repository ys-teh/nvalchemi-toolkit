Buffers & Data Flow
==============================

The dynamics framework uses a layered buffer architecture to manage
data flow between the active simulation batch, inter-rank
communication, and persistent storage. Understanding this architecture
is essential for optimizing throughput in multi-GPU pipelines and
debugging data routing issues.

Data flows from samplers or upstream ranks into the active batch,
through the dynamics step, and out to downstream ranks or sinks.


Pre-allocated communication buffers
-----------------------------------

.. currentmodule:: nvalchemi.dynamics.base

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated
   :template: class.rst
   :nosignatures:

   BufferConfig

Communication buffers are configured via
:class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BufferConfig`:

.. code-block:: python

   from nvalchemi.dynamics import DemoDynamics
   from nvalchemi.dynamics.base import BufferConfig

   buffer_config = BufferConfig(
       num_systems=64,    # max graphs in buffer
       num_nodes=2000,    # max total atoms
       num_edges=10000,   # max total edges
   )

   dynamics = DemoDynamics(
       model=model,
       n_steps=1000,
       dt=1.0,
       buffer_config=buffer_config,
   )

**Lazy initialization.** Buffers are created on the first step via
``_ensure_buffers()``. The first concrete batch serves as a template
for attribute keys, dtypes, and trailing shapes (e.g., hidden
dimensions). This lazy approach is necessary because the attribute
schema is not known until a real batch appears.

**The buffer lifecycle.**  Communication buffers (``send_buffer`` and
``recv_buffer``) follow a ``Batch.empty()`` → ``put()`` → ``zero()``
cycle:

1. :meth:`Batch.empty() <nvalchemi.data.Batch.empty>` allocates storage
   with zero graphs but full capacity.
2. :meth:`Batch.put() <nvalchemi.data.Batch.put>` copies selected
   graphs from a source batch using Warp GPU kernels.
3. :meth:`Batch.zero() <nvalchemi.data.Batch.zero>` resets occupancy
   while preserving allocated memory.

After ``put()`` extracts converged graphs into the send buffer, the
*active batch* (the working simulation state) is rebuilt without those
graphs via :meth:`Batch.trim() <nvalchemi.data.Batch.trim>`, which
returns a new :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` with tight storage — no
padding, no trailing buffer slots.

**``trim`` vs ``defrag``.**  :meth:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch.defrag`
compacts data to the front of a pre-allocated buffer **in-place**,
preserving the physical capacity for further ``put`` / ``defrag``
cycles.  :meth:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch.trim` instead creates a
brand-new batch whose tensors are sized to exactly fit the remaining
graphs.  Use ``defrag`` for reusable communication buffers; use
``trim`` for batches that will be consumed directly by a model or
integrator and must have self-consistent tensor shapes.

.. warning::

   :meth:`Batch.put() <nvalchemi.data.Batch.put>` uses Warp GPU kernels
   that only copy **float32** attributes. Integer and other dtypes may
   need separate handling.

.. note::

   Every stage in a :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.DistributedPipeline`
   must provide a ``BufferConfig``, and adjacent stages must have
   identical values. Both constraints are validated during
   ``setup()``.


The communication protocol
--------------------------

:class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.DistributedPipeline` uses a five-phase step
to coordinate data flow between ranks:

1. **_prestep_sync_buffers()**: Zeros the send buffer and posts
   ``irecv`` from the prior rank (using a pre-computed template for
   correct buffer shapes).  In sync mode the receive completes inline;
   in async modes the handle is stored for later completion.

2. **_complete_pending_recv()**: Waits on the deferred receive, routes
   data through the recv buffer into the active batch (stripping buffer
   padding via ``to_data_list`` / ``from_data_list``), and drains
   overflow sinks to backfill any available capacity.

3. **step()**: The dynamics integration step (forward pass, pre_update,
   post_update, convergence check).

4. **_poststep_sync_buffers()**: Extracts converged samples into the
   send buffer via ``_populate_send_buffer`` (subject to back-pressure).
   The send buffer is then **unconditionally sent** to the next rank.
   On the final rank, converged samples are extracted via
   ``_remove_converged_final_stage`` and written to sinks.

5. **_sync_done_flags()**: All ranks synchronize ``done`` flags via
   ``dist.all_reduce(MAX)``; the loop terminates when every rank
   reports done.

**Communication modes:**

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Mode
     - Behavior
   * - ``"sync"``
     - Blocking receive in ``_prestep_sync_buffers``. Simplest and most
       debuggable. Good for small pipelines.
   * - ``"async_recv"``
     - Deferred receive: ``irecv`` is posted in ``_prestep_sync_buffers``
       but ``wait()`` is called later in ``_complete_pending_recv``.
       Allows compute to overlap with communication. **Default mode.**
   * - ``"fully_async"``
     - Both send and receive are deferred. Sends from the previous step
       are drained at the start of the next ``_prestep_sync_buffers``.
       Maximum overlap, highest throughput.

**Template sharing.**  During ``setup()``, the pipeline computes recv
templates for every stage via ``_share_templates()``.  Since all stages
are available on every rank, this is done locally without inter-rank
communication.  Inflight (first) stages build their initial batch from
the sampler; downstream stages derive templates from their upstream
neighbour.  Templates are used to pre-allocate correctly shaped
``irecv`` buffers.

**Non-blocking receives.**  ``_BatchRecvHandle.wait()`` uses
non-blocking ``dist.irecv`` for all message components (metadata,
segment lengths, and bulk tensor data) and waits on all handles at the
end.  This enables better overlap with computation compared to the
previous blocking ``dist.recv`` approach.

**Deadlock prevention.** When no samples converge, an empty send buffer
is still sent so the downstream ``irecv`` completes.  This ensures the
pipeline does not stall waiting for data that will never arrive.


Back-pressure
-------------

When the ``send_buffer`` capacity is limited:

- Only ``min(converged_count, remaining_capacity)`` samples are
  extracted via ``_populate_send_buffer``.
- The active batch is replaced by a tight copy (via ``trim()``) that
  excludes the graduated samples.
- Excess converged samples that did not fit in the send buffer remain
  in the active batch.
- ``step()`` treats them as no-ops: their positions and velocities are
  saved before the integrator and restored after (the ``active_mask``
  logic in :meth:`BaseDynamics.step() <nvalchemi.dynamics.BaseDynamics.step>`).
- The send buffer is sent **unconditionally** every step for deadlock
  prevention, even when empty.


Data routing helpers
--------------------

The :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base._CommunicationMixin` provides
several helper methods for routing data between buffers:

- **_recv_to_batch(incoming)**: Stages data through the recv buffer
  into the active batch via ``_buffer_to_batch``, then zeros the
  recv buffer.

- **_buffer_to_batch(incoming)**: Routes incoming data into the active
  batch.  All code paths reconstruct the batch via
  :meth:`to_data_list() <nvalchemi.data.Batch.to_data_list>` +
  :meth:`from_data_list() <nvalchemi.data.Batch.from_data_list>` to
  strip buffer padding and produce tight tensors.  Three cases:

  1. No active batch exists: adopt the incoming data directly.
  2. Room available: append to the existing active batch.
  3. No room: overflow to sinks.

- **_batch_to_buffer(mask)**: Copies graduated samples from the active
  batch into the send buffer via :meth:`put()
  <nvalchemi.data.Batch.put>`, then replaces the active batch with a
  tight copy via :meth:`trim() <nvalchemi.data.Batch.trim>` (or sets
  it to ``None`` if every graph was graduated).

- **_populate_send_buffer(converged_indices)**: Creates a boolean mask
  from converged indices and delegates to ``_batch_to_buffer``.  Does
  not send — the caller issues ``isend`` separately.

- **_remove_converged_final_stage(converged_indices)**: On the final
  stage, extracts converged graphs via ``index_select``, removes them
  from the active batch, and writes them to sinks.

- **_manage_send_handle(handle)**: Stores the send handle for later
  draining (``fully_async``) or waits on it immediately (other modes).

- **_overflow_to_sinks(batch, mask)**: Writes to the first non-full
  sink in priority order.

- **_drain_sinks_to_batch()**: Pulls samples from sinks back into the
  active batch when room is available.

.. note::

   ``_buffer_to_batch`` uses :meth:`to_data_list()
   <nvalchemi.data.Batch.to_data_list>` + :meth:`from_data_list()
   <nvalchemi.data.Batch.from_data_list>` for combining batches. This
   is O(N) Python-level reconstruction. In high-throughput pipelines,
   this can be a bottleneck compared to the Warp-accelerated
   ``put`` / ``defrag`` path.


Sample lifecycle
----------------

This section traces a sample's journey through three representative
workflows.

**Standalone BaseDynamics.run()**

.. graphviz::
   :caption: Standalone ``BaseDynamics.run()`` lifecycle.

   digraph standalone_run {
       rankdir=TB
       node [fontsize=11 shape=box style="rounded,filled" fillcolor="#1a1a1a"]
       edge [fontsize=10]

       input  [label="Batch passed to run()" fillcolor="#1a1a1a"]
       loop   [label="loop for n_steps" shape=diamond fillcolor="#4a3315"]
       pre    [label="pre_update"]
       comp   [label="compute"]
       post   [label="post_update"]
       conv   [label="convergence check"]
       output [label="return batch" fillcolor="#1a1a1a"]

       input -> loop [style=bold]
       loop -> pre [style=bold]
       pre -> comp -> post -> conv [style=bold]
       conv -> loop [label="next step" style=dashed color="#999999"]
       loop -> output [label="done" style=bold]
   }

The simplest workflow: a batch is passed in, stepped for ``n_steps``
iterations, and returned.


**FusedStage with inflight batching**

.. graphviz::
   :caption: FusedStage inflight batching lifecycle.

   digraph fused_lifecycle {
       rankdir=TB
       node [fontsize=11 shape=box style="rounded,filled" fillcolor="#1a1a1a"]
       edge [fontsize=10]

       init [label="1. sampler.build_initial_batch()\nstatus=0, fmax=inf" fillcolor="#1a1a1a"]
       step [label="2. masked pre_updates → shared compute() →\nmasked post_updates based on batch.status"]
       conv [label="3. ConvergenceHook\nupdates batch.status\n(0 → 1 → 2 …)"]
       refill [label="4. _refill_check()\nevery refill_frequency steps" fillcolor="#4a3315"]
       refill_detail [label="identify graduated (status ≥ exit_status)\nwrite to sinks · extract remaining\nrequest replacements · rebuild tensors" shape=plaintext fillcolor=none style=""]
       term [label="5. Terminate\nsampler exhausted + all graduated,\nor all reach exit_status" fillcolor="#1a1a1a"]

       init -> step [style=bold]
       step -> conv [style=bold]
       conv -> refill [style=bold]
       refill -> refill_detail [style=dotted arrowhead=none color="#999999"]
       refill -> step [label="next step" style=dashed color="#999999"]
       refill -> term [label="done" style=bold]
   }

Samples migrate through sub-stages based on convergence, and graduated
samples are continuously replaced from the sampler.

           r0_refill -> r0_step [label="loop" style=dashed color="#999999"]
       }

       subgraph cluster_mid {
           label="Rank 1 … N−1  (middle)"
           style=rounded
           color="#e6a817"

       }

       rn_sink   -> allreduce [style=dotted color="#999999" ltail=cluster_rankN]
   }

Samples flow from the first rank through intermediate ranks to the
final rank, where they are persisted to sinks.


Data sinks
----------

Three :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.DataSink` implementations are
available:

- :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.GPUBuffer`: Pre-allocates on first write.
  Uses :meth:`Batch.put() <nvalchemi.data.Batch.put>` internally. Has a
  known performance limitation: ``read()`` falls back to
  :meth:`to_data_list() <nvalchemi.data.Batch.to_data_list>` instead
  of :meth:`index_select() <nvalchemi.data.Batch.index_select>` due to
  Warp int32/int64 dtype incompatibility.

- :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.HostMemory`: CPU-resident, decomposes
  batches into :class:`~nvalchemi.data.AtomicData` lists.

- :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.ZarrData`: Disk-backed, delegates to
  :class:`~nvalchemi.data.AtomicDataZarrWriter`.

Sinks are tried in priority order; the first non-full sink receives
the data.

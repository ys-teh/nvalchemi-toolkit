============================================
``FusedStage`` — Single-GPU Orchestration
============================================

:class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.FusedStage` composes multiple dynamics
sub-stages on a **single GPU**, sharing one ``Batch`` and **one model
forward pass** per step. This eliminates redundant forward passes when
multiple simulation phases (e.g. relaxation → MD) operate on the same
hardware. Within the :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.DistributedPipeline`
paradigm, ``FusedStage`` is the mechanism used to allow for more than
one dynamics process to run on a single rank.

The ``+`` operator
------------------

The primary way to build a ``FusedStage`` is with the ``+`` operator:

.. code-block:: python

   from nvalchemi.dynamics import DemoDynamics

   optimizer = DemoDynamics(model=model, n_steps=1000, dt=0.5)
   md = DemoDynamics(model=model, n_steps=1000, dt=1.0)

   # Fuse two dynamics → one forward pass per step
   fused = optimizer + md

Chaining is supported for three or more stages:

.. code-block:: python

   stage_a = DemoDynamics(model=model, n_steps=1000, dt=0.5)
   stage_b = DemoDynamics(model=model, n_steps=1000, dt=1.0)
   stage_c = DemoDynamics(model=model, n_steps=1000, dt=2.0)

   # (stage_a + stage_b) returns a FusedStage
   # FusedStage + stage_c appends via FusedStage.__add__
   fused = stage_a + stage_b + stage_c

   print(fused)
   # FusedStage(sub_stages=[0:DemoDynamics, 1:DemoDynamics, 2:DemoDynamics],
   #            entry_status=0, exit_status=3, compiled=False, step_count=0)


How it works: status codes and masked updates
----------------------------------------------

Each sub-stage is assigned a **status code** (auto-assigned starting
from 0 when using ``+``). Every sample in the batch carries a
``batch.status`` tensor that determines which sub-stage processes it:

.. graphviz::
   :caption: A single fused step with status-based masked updates.

   digraph fused_step {
       rankdir=TB
       node [fontsize=11 shape=box style="rounded,filled" fillcolor="#1a1a1a"]
       edge [fontsize=10]

       subgraph cluster_step {
           label="FusedStage.step()"
           style=rounded
           color="#76b900"
           fontcolor="#76b900"
           fontsize=12

           batch   [label="Batch (8 samples)\nstatus: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]" fillcolor="#4a3315"]
           pre0    [label="1a. sub_stage[0]._masked_pre_update\nstatus == 0  →  samples 0, 1, 2, 5, 7"]
           pre1    [label="1b. sub_stage[1]._masked_pre_update\nstatus == 1  →  samples 3, 4, 6"]
           compute [label="2. compute()\nsingle shared forward pass for ALL 8 samples"]
           post0   [label="3a. sub_stage[0]._masked_post_update\nstatus == 0  →  samples 0, 1, 2, 5, 7"]
           post1   [label="3b. sub_stage[1]._masked_post_update\nstatus == 1  →  samples 3, 4, 6"]
           conv    [label="4. convergence check\nper sub-stage"]
           migrate [label="sample 2 converges → status[2] = 1\n(migrated!)" shape=plaintext fillcolor=none style=""]

           batch -> pre0 [style=bold]
           pre0 -> pre1 -> compute -> post0 -> post1 -> conv [style=bold]
           conv -> migrate [style=dashed color="#999999"]
       }
   }

The key insight is that **only one forward pass happens** regardless of
how many sub-stages exist. Each sub-stage applies its masked ``pre_update()``
before that shared evaluation and its masked ``post_update()`` afterward. The
expensive model evaluation is amortized across all stages.


Convergence-driven stage migration
-----------------------------------

``FusedStage.__init__`` automatically registers ``ConvergenceHook``
instances between adjacent sub-stages:

.. code-block:: python

   fused = optimizer + md

   # Equivalent to manually doing:
   # optimizer gets: ConvergenceHook(source_status=0, target_status=1)
   # exit_status = 2  (one past the last sub-stage code)

When a sample in sub-stage 0 (optimizer) converges:

1. Its ``batch.status`` is updated from ``0`` → ``1``
2. On the next step, it is processed by sub-stage 1 (MD)
3. When it converges in sub-stage 1, its status becomes ``2``
   (= ``exit_status``)
4. It is graduated (either written to sinks or replaced via inflight
   batching)

Optional force reprime on sub-stage entry
-----------------------------------------

Some stages require model outputs to be refreshed under the target stage's
context before their integrator or optimizer advances. This ensures that
the entering graphs are processed correctly by the target-stage 
``AFTER_COMPUTE`` hooks.

.. code-block:: python

   fused = FusedStage(
       sub_stages=[(0, optimizer), (1, md)],
       reprime_on_entry={1},
   )

Graphs entering status ``1`` skip its updates and counters until the next
shared compute refreshes their outputs. They may then converge or update on
the following iteration. Existing status ``1`` graphs continue normally.
This is separate from the initial batch-wide force prime.


Running a ``FusedStage``
-------------------------

``FusedStage.run()`` loops until all samples reach ``exit_status``, the sampler
is exhausted, or the maximum ``n_steps`` is reached. An ``n_steps`` argument
overrides ``FusedStage.n_steps``. When both are ``None``, termination is
convergence- or sampler-driven. A sub-stage's own ``n_steps`` limits how many
steps each system remains in that sub-stage before moving to the next one.

**Mode 1: external batch (the common case)**

.. code-block:: python

   fused = optimizer + md
   result = fused.run(batch)
   # Returns when all samples have status == exit_status

**Mode 2: inflight batching with a sampler**

.. code-block:: python

   from nvalchemi.dynamics import SizeAwareSampler

   sampler = SizeAwareSampler(
       dataset=my_dataset,
       max_atoms=200,
       max_edges=1000,
       max_batch_size=64,
   )

   fused = optimizer + md
   # Configure the sampler on the fused stage
   fused.sampler = sampler
   fused.refill_frequency = 1

   result = fused.run()  # batch built from sampler automatically

   # result is None when sampler is exhausted and all samples graduated

In inflight mode, graduated samples are **replaced in-place** using
dummy-graph pointer manipulation---no batch reconstruction overhead.


Using a CUDA stream
--------------------

Use the context manager to run all computation on a dedicated CUDA
stream:

.. code-block:: python

   fused = optimizer + md

   with fused:
       fused.run(batch)
       # All GPU ops run on a dedicated stream

The stream is automatically propagated to all sub-stages.


``torch.compile`` support
--------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   fused = FusedStage(
       sub_stages=[(0, optimizer), (1, md)],
       compile_step=True,
       compile_kwargs={"mode": "reduce-overhead", "fullgraph": True},
   )

When ``compile_step=True``, the internal ``_step_impl`` method is
wrapped with ``torch.compile``. This can significantly improve
throughput by fusing GPU kernels across the entire fused step.

Before entering ``_step_impl``, :class:`FusedStage` initializes bookkeeping and
sub-stage state, then dispatches ``ON_ADMISSION`` hooks at the fused and sub-stage
levels. Admission runs once for a new run or managed batch replacement and stays
outside the compiled graph. Use it for validation, shape-dependent allocation,
or other Python setup that is not safe in a per-step compiled hook.


Combining with hooks and sinks
-------------------------------

Hooks registered on individual sub-stages are respected inside the
fused step:

.. code-block:: python

   from nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks import LoggingHook, SnapshotHook
   from nvalchemi.dynamics import HostMemory

   sink = HostMemory(capacity=10_000)

   optimizer = DemoDynamics(
       model=model,
       n_steps=1000,
       dt=0.5,
       hooks=[LoggingHook(backend="csv", log_path="log.csv", frequency=100)],
   )
   md = DemoDynamics(
       model=model,
       n_steps=1000,
       dt=1.0,
       hooks=[SnapshotHook(sink=sink, frequency=10)],
   )

   fused = optimizer + md
   fused.run(batch)

   # LoggingHook fires every 100 steps for all samples
   # SnapshotHook fires every 10 steps and captures the full batch state


Explicit construction
---------------------

For advanced control, construct ``FusedStage`` directly:

.. code-block:: python

   from nvalchemi.dynamics import FusedStage, ConvergenceHook

   optimizer = DemoDynamics(
       model=model,
       n_steps=1000,
       dt=0.5,
       convergence_hook=ConvergenceHook(
           criteria=[
               {"key": "fmax", "threshold": 0.05},
               {"key": "energy_change", "threshold": 1e-6},
           ],
           source_status=0,
           target_status=1,
       ),
   )
   md = DemoDynamics(model=model, n_steps=1000, dt=1.0)

   fused = FusedStage(
       sub_stages=[(0, optimizer), (1, md)],
       entry_status=0,
       exit_status=2,
       compile_step=True,
   )

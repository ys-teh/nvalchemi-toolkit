# Reporting

Training runs and dynamics simulations both produce a constant stream of
structured data: loss components, learning rates, gradient norms, energy
trajectories, convergence fractions. Watching those numbers tells you whether a
run is healthy, whether it is worth continuing, and whether a change made things
better or worse. The problem is that wiring each metric into the lifecycle by
hand — a hook per metric, one per backend — quickly becomes its own maintenance
burden.

Reporting solves this at the layer above individual hooks. Register a single
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.ReportingOrchestrator` and tell it which lifecycle
stages and output backends you want. At each matching event it collects scalars
from the hook context, assembles a structured payload, handles rank reduction,
and fans the result out to every configured reporter. Training code does not
change when you add, remove, or replace a backend.

The design is deliberately minimal on the reporter side. The
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.Reporter` protocol requires one method —
`report(ctx, stage, state)`. That is enough to write a CSV exporter, a W&B
integration, a custom dashboard, or any other sink. The built-in reporters —
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.TensorBoardReporter` and
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.RichReporter` — satisfy the same protocol as a
custom one would, so switching or extending is a matter of swapping objects.

## Reporting versus logging

Logging and reporting have different intent, and the distinction helps you
choose the right tool for each output.

Logging captures a direct stream of events — per-batch rows, per-graph
observables, gradient statistics — in a form you can replay or audit after
the run. Each record corresponds to one event and contains whatever that event
produced. The built-in `LoggingHook` for dynamics works this way: by default,
it writes one row per system per step with energy, `fmax`, temperature, and
status. It can also write one row per batch group for explicitly supplied
scalars with one value per group using the `by_group=True` setting.

Reporting produces curated summaries. A reporter receives the hook context at a
chosen cadence, decides which scalars to extract, optionally reduces them across
ranks, and renders or serializes the result. Detail that does not belong in a
summary is intentionally dropped. The output is a compact dashboard or analysis
record, not a raw event log and so the interpretation would be reporting provides
insight, whereas logging just provides data. The
logger vs. reporter abstraction is backend agnostic, and so writing to CSV could
be done by either, however if you need to communicate between ranks, or do some
post-processing of the values, then write and use a reporter. More concretely,
a reporter or a logger could write to a CSV file, but in the latter case each rank
could write their own metrics asynchronously, while the former would provide the
ability to reduce the metrics across all workers.

## How reporting works

{py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.ReportingOrchestrator` is a standard hook — it
goes in `hooks=[...]` alongside everything else. The role of the orchestrator
is to act with the requested cadence on each provided reporter:

1. Updates shared {py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.ReportingState` with an event
   count, timestamps, and a bounded recent-message buffer.
2. Applies rank-zero gating for reporters that request it.
3. Calls each reporter with `(ctx, stage, state)`.
4. Applies the configured error policy if a reporter raises.

```{graphviz}
:caption: Reporting orchestrator flow, from workflow to output.
:alt: Reporting orchestrator flow

digraph reporting_flow {
    rankdir=TB

    workflow     [label="Workflow\n(training / dynamics / custom)"]
    context      [label="HookContext\n(context + stage enum)"]
    orchestrator [label="ReportingOrchestrator\n(cadence + reporter fan-out)"]
    state        [label="ReportingState\n(event metadata + recent messages)"]
    reporter     [label="Reporter\n(TensorBoard / Rich / custom)"]
    output       [label="Output\n(file / run log / dashboard)"]

    workflow -> context     [label="engine hook call"]
    context -> orchestrator [label="stage match"]
    orchestrator -> state   [label="mark event"]
    state -> reporter       [label="report"]
    reporter -> output      [label="write"]
}
```

Each reporter calls {py:func}`~nvalchemi.hooks.collect_scalars` to build a
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.ScalarSnapshot` — a frozen payload containing the
stage name, wall-clock timestamp, elapsed time, event and step counters, rank,
training epoch and batch metadata, and a flat dictionary of scalar values. Keys
use slash-separated paths:

- `loss/total`, `loss/{component}/unweighted`, `loss/{component}/weight` —
  from a composed loss
- `optimizer/0/lr`, `scheduler/0/lr` — learning rates from configured
  optimizers and schedulers
- `training/progress_fraction`, `training/eta_s`, `training/steps_per_s` —
  workflow progress and throughput (when available)
- `energy`, `fmax`, `temperature`, `converged_fraction` — dynamics observables
  when enabled

For distributed runs, all ranks independently collect their own scalar
snapshot. What changes per-reporter is what happens after collection:

- `requires_all_ranks = True` — all ranks participate in a collective
  reduction (mean, sum, min, or max). Once reduced, only rank zero calls
  `reporter.report()` with the merged snapshot; nonzero ranks return without
  writing.
- `rank_zero_only = True` — no reduction occurs. The orchestrator calls
  `reporter.report()` only on rank zero; nonzero ranks are skipped entirely.
- Neither flag set — each rank calls `reporter.report()` independently with
  its own local snapshot.

Set `requires_all_ranks` when the output needs cross-rank agreement — a global
mean loss, total throughput across all GPUs. Set `rank_zero_only` when
independence is acceptable and parallel writes to the same destination must be
avoided.

```{graphviz}
:caption: Distributed reporting: per-rank collection, reduction, and rank-zero write.
:alt: Distributed reporting reduction flow

digraph distributed_reporting {
    rankdir=TB

    r0 [label="rank 0\ncollect_scalars"]

    r0 -> reduce
    r1 -> reduce
    rn -> reduce
    reduce -> w0
    reduce -> wn
}
```

## Getting started

The minimal setup is one orchestrator with the reporters you want. Both
built-in reporters can be active at the same time and receive the same scalar
payload independently:

```python
from nvalchemi.hooks import ReportingOrchestrator, RichReporter, TensorBoardReporter
from nvalchemi.training import TrainingStrategy

reporting = ReportingOrchestrator(
    [
        TensorBoardReporter("runs/my-experiment"),
        RichReporter(),
    ],
    stages={"AFTER_OPTIMIZER_STEP"},
    frequency=10,
)

strategy = TrainingStrategy(
    ...,
    hooks=[reporting],
)
```

`stages` controls which lifecycle stages trigger a report. The default is
`{"AFTER_OPTIMIZER_STEP", "AFTER_STEP"}`, which covers both training and
dynamics workflows. Override it when you want reports at a different cadence
— for example, `{"AFTER_EPOCH"}` for epoch-level summaries only.

`frequency` throttles reporting to every N events at the configured stages.
For a long run where reporting every optimizer step adds unnecessary overhead,
`frequency=10` or higher keeps the output readable without missing trends.

`error_policy` controls what happens if a reporter raises. The default is
`ReportingErrorPolicy.RAISE`. Set it to `"warn"` or `"ignore"` when a broken
reporter should not abort the run:

```python
from nvalchemi.hooks import ReportingErrorPolicy, ReportingOrchestrator

reporting = ReportingOrchestrator(
    reporters=[...],
    stages={"AFTER_OPTIMIZER_STEP"},
    frequency=10,
    error_policy="warn",
)
```

## Built-in reporters

### TensorBoardReporter

Use {py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.TensorBoardReporter` when you want persistent,
replayable training curves — for comparing runs, archiving results, or
post-hoc analysis with TensorBoard's UI or any tool that reads event files.

```python
from nvalchemi.hooks import TensorBoardReporter

reporter = TensorBoardReporter(
    "runs/my-experiment",
    tag_prefix="train",  # prepended to all tags: "train/loss/total", etc.
    flush=True,          # flush after every event
)
```

Each reporting event writes one scalar per key in the snapshot using the step
count as the global step. Keys become TensorBoard tags directly: `loss/total`,
`optimizer/0/lr`, `training/progress_fraction`, and so on. The writer
initializes lazily on the first event, so constructing the reporter before the
run starts is safe.

For distributed runs, set `rank_reduction` to control how scalars are combined
before rank zero writes them. When `None` (the default), each rank writes
independently. Pass `"mean"` or `"sum"` to reduce across all ranks — all ranks
must report the same scalar keys when reduction is enabled.

`TensorBoardReporter` requires `tensorboard` to be installed. Construction
raises if the dependency is missing.

### RichReporter

Use {py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.RichReporter` when you want to watch a run in
progress. It renders scalar snapshots as a live terminal dashboard using Rich's
`Live` display, showing loss curves, learning rates, throughput, and ETA in
real time without checking a file or browser.

```python
from nvalchemi.hooks import RichReporter

reporter = RichReporter(
    layout="training",     # built-in layout; see below for options
    history_size=200,      # (step, value) points retained per metric
    precision=6,           # significant digits in the latest-value table
    refresh_per_second=2.0,
)
```

The `layout` parameter controls which dashboard surface is rendered. Pass
`"training"` for a training-focused view, `"dynamics"` for a dynamics
simulation view, `None` for automatic selection based on the first context
received, or a custom `RichLayout` object to build your own surface. Layout
design is covered in detail in [Designing Rich layouts](#designing-rich-layouts).

`plot_keys`, `max_plots`, and `plot_height` control which metrics get
time-series panels and how large those panels are. `rank_reduction`,
`custom_scalars`, `include_losses`, and `include_optimizer_lrs` behave the
same as for `TensorBoardReporter`.

You can preview any layout without running a workflow:

```python
RichReporter.preview(layout="training", title="training dashboard")
RichReporter.preview(layout="dynamics", title="dynamics dashboard")
```

Those two calls render the dashboards below. Both share the same skeleton — a
column of at-a-glance value panels on the left, time-series plots on the right,
and a `Messages` panel for reporter output — and differ in what they choose to
put in each slot:

| | `"training"` | `"dynamics"` |
|---|---|---|
| Value panels | `Latest Metrics`, `Progress` | `Observables`, `Convergence / Pipeline` |
| Plot panel | `Training Curves` | `Dynamics Traces` |
| Plotted by default | `loss/total`, `optimizer/lr`, `scheduler/lr`, per-component losses | `energy`, `fmax`, `temperature`, `energy_drift`, `converged_fraction`, `active_fraction` |
| Question it answers | Is the loss coming down, and how long is left? | Is the simulation healthy, and how much of the batch has converged? |

The `"training"` layout leads with the loss breakdown, learning rates, and
progress/ETA — the things you watch to decide whether a run is worth continuing:

```{figure} /_static/rich_reporter_training.svg
:alt: RichReporter training layout showing loss curves, learning rate, and progress
:width: 100%

The built-in `"training"` layout, rendered by
`RichReporter.preview(layout="training")`.
```

The `"dynamics"` layout swaps those for simulation observables and a
convergence/pipeline panel, since a batched relaxation is judged on how many
systems have finished rather than on a single scalar going down:

```{figure} /_static/rich_reporter_dynamics.svg
:alt: RichReporter dynamics layout showing energy, fmax, temperature, and convergence
:width: 100%

The built-in `"dynamics"` layout, rendered by
`RichReporter.preview(layout="dynamics")`.
```

Neither is fixed: `plot_keys`, `max_plots`, and `plot_height` retune the plot
panel without writing a layout, and a custom
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.RichLayout` replaces the surface entirely (see
[Designing Rich layouts](#designing-rich-layouts)).

For an animated live-data demo using synthetic metrics:

```bash
uv run python examples/intermediate/07_rich_training_reporting.py --steps 80 --delay 0.05
```

## Designing Rich layouts

The terminal dashboard is the most visible reporting surface during a run. A
layout that surfaces the right metrics at a glance — loss trajectory, learning
rate, convergence fraction, throughput — makes it significantly easier to catch
problems early and understand what a run is doing. The layout system is designed
so you can build the dashboard that suits your workflow and workstyle: a
validation-focused view for fine-tuning, a compact single-metric status bar for
debugging, or a fully custom multi-panel surface for complex pipelines.

`RichReporter` manages everything that is not rendering: the Rich `Live`
context, scalar collection, history retention, rank filtering, and refresh
cadence. Your layout is a rendering policy — given the current snapshot and
history, return a Rich renderable. It owns no lifecycle, no state, no
distributed logic.

### Built-in layouts

#### Training layout

{py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.TrainingRichLayout` (`layout="training"`) is
optimized for monitoring an active training run. It surfaces:

- **Latest metrics** — a table of current scalars in display order, updated
  at each reporting event
- **Progress sidebar** — step count, epoch, throughput, and ETA
- **Training curves** — time-series plots for `loss/total`, learning rate,
  and per-component losses
- **Messages panel** — recent reporter messages and warnings

Use `"training"` for any training or fine-tuning workflow. It automatically
picks up all loss components from a composed loss, learning rates from all
configured optimizers and schedulers, and progress information when the
training context exposes it. Pin it explicitly when you do not want automatic
layout selection from the first context:

```python
reporter = RichReporter(layout="training")
```

#### Dynamics layout

{py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.DynamicsRichLayout` (`layout="dynamics"`) is
optimized for monitoring a molecular dynamics or geometry optimization
simulation. It surfaces:

- **Observables** — energy, `fmax`, temperature, convergence fraction
- **Pipeline sidebar** — active count, graduated count, per-status breakdown
- **Dynamics traces** — time-series plots for energy, `fmax`, temperature,
  and convergence fraction
- **Messages panel** — recent reporter messages and warnings

This layout also sets `include_dynamics_scalars = True`, which tells
`RichReporter` to collect default dynamics observables from the context
automatically — without this, energy, temperature, and convergence would not
appear in the snapshot.

```python
reporter = RichReporter(layout="dynamics")
```

### Subclassing BaseRichLayout

When none of the built-in layouts fits your workflow but you want the same
general structure — header, latest-metric table, time-series plots, messages
panel — subclass {py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.BaseRichLayout`. The base class
owns the panel structure and Rich rendering; you supply the preferred plot
metrics, panel titles, and preview curves.

```python
from nvalchemi.hooks import BaseRichLayout, RichReporter


class ValidationRichLayout(BaseRichLayout):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__(
            name="validation",
            preferred_plot_keys=("validation/loss", "validation/mae"),
            latest_title="Validation Metrics",
            history_title="Validation Curves",
        )

    def default_preview_history(self):
        return {
            "validation/loss": (0.8, 0.62, 0.51, 0.44),
            "validation/mae": (0.31, 0.24, 0.19, 0.16),
        }


reporter = RichReporter(layout=ValidationRichLayout())
```

`ValidationRichLayout` inherits the full `BaseRichLayout` panel structure — a
table of latest scalars, time-series plots, and a messages panel — but wires it
to validation metrics rather than training ones. Each constructor argument
controls a distinct part of that structure:

- `name` — layout identifier used in log output and error traces
- `preferred_plot_keys` — metrics that get dedicated time-series panels, listed
  in display order; other scalars appear in the table but not the plots
- `latest_title` / `history_title` — section headers for the scalar table and
  the time-series plots region respectively
- `default_preview_history` — synthetic `(step, value)` sequences used by
  `RichReporter.preview()` to render a static mock-up without a live run

Override the preview metadata methods when the default training context does
not match your workflow. A validation-only layout, for example, may not have
a meaningful epoch or batch count:

```python
class ValidationRichLayout(BaseRichLayout):
    ...

    def default_preview_stage(self) -> str:
        return "AFTER_VALIDATION"

    def default_preview_epoch(self) -> int | None:
        return None

    def default_preview_batch_count(self) -> int | None:
        return None
```

Set `include_dynamics_scalars=True` in the `super().__init__(...)` call if
your workflow also needs dynamics observables in the snapshot.

Once the layout class is defined, pass it as the `layout` argument to
`RichReporter`. The layout and reporter are independent — the layout renders;
the reporter owns the `Live` context, history retention, and refresh cadence:

```python
from nvalchemi.hooks import ReportingOrchestrator, RichReporter

reporter = RichReporter(layout=ValidationRichLayout())
reporting = ReportingOrchestrator([reporter], stages={"AFTER_VALIDATION"})
```

### Implementing RichLayout directly

When the header-table-plots structure does not fit — a compact single-line
status bar, a side-by-side rank comparison, a custom pipeline-status panel —
implement {py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.RichLayout` directly. This gives you full
control over the rendered surface while `RichReporter` still manages everything
else: `Live`, scalar collection, history retention, rank filtering, and refresh.

The protocol requires five methods and one class attribute:

```python
from nvalchemi.hooks import RichReporter, ScalarSnapshot
from nvalchemi.hooks.reporting.layouts import RichMetricHistory


class CompactLayout:
    include_dynamics_scalars = False  # True to add dynamics observables

    def default_preview_history(self):
        return {"my/metric": (1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4)}

    def default_preview_stage(self) -> str:
        return "AFTER_OPTIMIZER_STEP"

    def default_preview_epoch(self) -> int | None:
        return 3

    def default_preview_batch_count(self) -> int | None:
        return 128

    def render(
        self,
        snapshot: ScalarSnapshot | None,
        history: RichMetricHistory,
        *,
        title: str,
        precision: int,
        max_scalars: int | None,
        plot_keys,
        max_plots: int,
        plot_height: int,
    ):
        ...  # return a Rich renderable
```

`snapshot` is the latest {py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.ScalarSnapshot`, or
`None` before the first reporting event — always guard against `None`. Use
`snapshot.scalars` for current values, `snapshot.messages` for recent reporter
messages or warnings. `history` maps metric keys to sequences of
`(step, value)` tuples, useful for drawing trend lines or sparklines. The
remaining parameters are display preferences passed through from `RichReporter`
and controllable by the user at reporter-construction time.

Do not create a nested `Rich.Live` inside `render`. `RichReporter` owns the
`Live` context; your layout's job is to return a renderable, nothing else.

The following Rich components cover most layout needs:

| Component | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| `Layout` | Split the terminal into named regions for independent panels. |
| `Panel` | Frame a region, table, or group with a title and border. |
| `Table` | Show latest scalar values, rank summaries, or pipeline status. |
| `Text` | Build styled labels and compact status lines. |
| `Group` | Stack multiple renderables inside one layout region. |
| `Columns` | Arrange small repeated panels, such as per-rank summaries. |
| `Align`, `Padding` | Position or pad a renderable without a new region. |

A complete minimal layout that renders all current scalars in a compact table:

```python
from rich import box
from rich.console import Group
from rich.layout import Layout
from rich.panel import Panel
from rich.table import Table
from rich.text import Text

from nvalchemi.hooks import RichReporter, ScalarSnapshot
from nvalchemi.hooks.reporting.layouts import RichMetricHistory


class CompactLayout:
    include_dynamics_scalars = False

    def default_preview_history(self):
        return {"my/metric": (1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4)}

    def default_preview_stage(self) -> str:
        return "AFTER_OPTIMIZER_STEP"

    def default_preview_epoch(self) -> int | None:
        return 3

    def default_preview_batch_count(self) -> int | None:
        return 128

    def render(
        self,
        snapshot: ScalarSnapshot | None,
        history: RichMetricHistory,
        *,
        title: str,
        precision: int,
        max_scalars: int | None,
        plot_keys,
        max_plots: int,
        plot_height: int,
    ) -> Layout:
        layout = Layout(name="root")
        layout.split_column(
            Layout(name="header", size=3),
            Layout(name="body"),
        )
        subtitle = Text(
            "waiting for metrics" if snapshot is None else snapshot.stage
        )
        layout["header"].update(
            Panel(Group(Text(title), subtitle), box=box.SIMPLE)
        )
        table = Table(box=box.SIMPLE_HEAD, expand=True)
        table.add_column("Metric")
        table.add_column("Latest", justify="right")
        if snapshot is None:
            table.add_row("(waiting)", "")
        else:
            for key, value in sorted(snapshot.scalars.items()):
                table.add_row(key, f"{value:.{precision}g}")
        layout["body"].update(Panel(table, title="Summary"))
        return layout


reporter = RichReporter(layout=CompactLayout())
```

### Previewing layouts

Any layout can be previewed as a static render without starting a workflow.
This is the right way to tune panel structure, verify that metric labels look
right, and check that `default_preview_history` curves are representative:

```python
RichReporter.preview(layout="training", title="training dashboard")
RichReporter.preview(layout=ValidationRichLayout(), title="validation run")
```

For an animated preview with synthetic metrics updating in real time, the
bundled example covers both built-in layouts and accepts `--steps` and
`--delay` to control how long it runs:

```bash
uv run python examples/intermediate/07_rich_training_reporting.py --steps 80 --delay 0.05
```

## Writing your own reporter

Any object with a `report(ctx, stage, state)` method satisfies the
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.Reporter` protocol. Where a logger writes one record
per event without filtering, a reporter decides what to write and when — the
result is a curated summary, not a raw event stream.

The example below writes per-epoch summary statistics rather than one row per
reporting event. It accumulates scalar snapshots during the epoch, then flushes
a single mean-per-metric row when an epoch boundary is detected:

```python
import csv

from nvalchemi.hooks import collect_scalars


class EpochSummaryReporter:
    rank_zero_only = True

    def __init__(self, path: str) -> None:
        self._path = path
        self._file = None
        self._writer = None
        self._keys = None
        self._epoch = None
        self._epoch_values = {}

    def __enter__(self):
        self._file = open(self._path, "w", newline="")
        self._writer = csv.writer(self._file)
        return self

    def __exit__(self, *args):
        self._flush()
        if self._file is not None:
            self._file.close()

    def report(self, ctx, stage, state) -> None:
        snapshot = collect_scalars(ctx, stage, state)
        if self._epoch is not None and snapshot.epoch != self._epoch:
            self._flush()
            self._epoch_values = {}
        self._epoch = snapshot.epoch
        for key, value in snapshot.scalars.items():
            self._epoch_values.setdefault(key, []).append(value)

    def _flush(self) -> None:
        if self._epoch is None or not self._epoch_values:
            return
        if self._keys is None:
            self._keys = list(self._epoch_values)
            self._writer.writerow(["epoch"] + self._keys)
        means = []
        for k in self._keys:
            values = self._epoch_values.get(k, [])
            means.append(sum(values) / len(values) if values else None)
        self._writer.writerow([self._epoch] + means)
```

The same protocol works for any experiment-tracking backend. A W&B integration
follows the same skeleton: `wandb.init()` in `__enter__`, `run.log(scalars,
step=...)` in `report`, and `run.finish()` in `__exit__`. The payload in
`snapshot.scalars` maps directly to what W&B, MLflow, and similar tools expect.

Three optional attributes integrate with the orchestrator:

- `rank_zero_only = True` — the orchestrator skips this reporter on nonzero
  ranks entirely. Use this for any reporter that writes to a file or serial
  destination.
- `requires_all_ranks = True` — the reporter participates in a distributed
  collective reduction before receiving the final snapshot. Use this when
  you want cross-rank metrics such as the mean loss across all GPUs.
- Context manager protocol (`__enter__` / `__exit__`) or `close()` — the
  orchestrator calls these at the boundaries of the training run, so file
  handles, writers, and external connections open and close cleanly.

{py:func}`~nvalchemi.hooks.collect_scalars` accepts the same `include_losses`,
`include_optimizer_lrs`, `include_dynamics`, and `custom_scalars` flags as the
built-in reporters, so you get the same structured payload with a single call.

To add messages visible in the Rich dashboard or accessible to downstream
reporters, write to `state.add_message(level, text, reporter=self)`. Messages
are bounded by `state.max_messages` and surface in `snapshot.messages` on
subsequent events.

Register a custom reporter the same way as any built-in one:

```python
from nvalchemi.hooks import ReportingOrchestrator, RichReporter
from nvalchemi.training import TrainingStrategy

strategy = TrainingStrategy(
    ...,
    hooks=[
        ReportingOrchestrator(
            [EpochSummaryReporter("metrics.csv"), RichReporter()],
            stages={"AFTER_OPTIMIZER_STEP"},
            frequency=10,
        )
    ],
)
```

### Adding custom scalars

Both built-in reporters and custom reporters accept a `custom_scalars` mapping
that adds metrics beyond what automatic collection covers. Each entry maps a
string key to a callable with signature `(ctx, stage) -> float | Mapping | None`:

```python
from nvalchemi.hooks import TensorBoardReporter


def gradient_norm(ctx, stage):
    model = getattr(ctx, "model", None)
    if model is None:
        return None
    total_sq = sum(
        p.grad.norm().item() ** 2
        for p in model.parameters()
        if p.grad is not None
    )
    return total_sq ** 0.5


reporter = TensorBoardReporter(
    "runs/example",
    custom_scalars={"diagnostics/grad_norm": gradient_norm},
)
```

A callback that returns `None` is silently omitted from the snapshot — use
this to guard against missing context fields without raising.

To suppress automatic scalar collection and use only custom scalars, set
`include_losses=False` and `include_optimizer_lrs=False`:

```python
reporter = RichReporter(
    include_losses=False,
    include_optimizer_lrs=False,
    custom_scalars={"diagnostics/grad_norm": gradient_norm},
)
```

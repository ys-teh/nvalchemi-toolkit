# Dynamics: Optimization and Molecular Dynamics

The dynamics module provides a unified framework for running geometry optimizations
and molecular dynamics simulations on GPU. All simulation types share a common
execution loop --- hooks, model evaluation, convergence checking --- so you learn the
pattern once and apply it to any integrator.

```{tip}
It is important to keep in mind that ``nvalchemi`` follows a batch-first principle:
users should think and reason about dynamics workflows with multiple structures
simultaneously, as opposed to individual structures being processed sequentially.
```

custom integrators.
```

## The execution loop

Every simulation is driven by {py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BaseDynamics`,
which defines a single `step()` that all integrators and optimizers follow. The
loop is broken into discrete stages, enumerated by
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.DynamicsStage`:

| Stage | When it fires |
|-------|---------------|
| `ON_ADMISSION` | Once when a batch enters the engine, before force priming and the first step |
| `BEFORE_STEP` | At the very beginning of a step, before any operations |
| `BEFORE_PRE_UPDATE` | Just before the integrator's first half-step |
| `AFTER_PRE_UPDATE` | After the first half-step completes |
| `BEFORE_COMPUTE` | Just before the model forward pass |
| `AFTER_COMPUTE` | After the model forward pass completes |
| `BEFORE_POST_UPDATE` | Just before the integrator's second half-step |
| `AFTER_POST_UPDATE` | After the second half-step completes |
| `AFTER_STEP` | At the very end of a step, after all operations |
| `ON_CONVERGE` | After convergence evaluation; for fused sub-stages, runs at the hook’s configured interval |
| `ON_GRADUATE` | After `ON_CONVERGE`; `ctx.graduated_mask` marks the systems whose status reached `exit_status` this step. Dispatched whenever a hook listens and the batch carries a `status` column, so the mask may be all `False` |

When a batch is newly admitted, **ON_ADMISSION** hooks fire before force
priming and before the first step. Admission is reset for every new `run()` and
for managed membership changes such as inflight refill or pipeline communication.
Repeated `step()` calls do not re-fire admission until it is reset. Because
admission is an event rather than a recurring step stage, it ignores a hook's
`frequency`; for a multi-stage hook, the frequency still applies at its other
stages.

Each step then proceeds through these stages in order:

1. **BEFORE_STEP** hooks fire.
2. `pre_update(batch)` --- the integrator's first half-step (e.g. update velocities
   by half a timestep), bracketed by BEFORE/AFTER_PRE_UPDATE hooks.
3. `compute(batch)` --- the wrapped ML model evaluates forces (and stress, if
   needed), bracketed by BEFORE/AFTER_COMPUTE hooks.
4. `post_update(batch)` --- the integrator's second half-step (e.g. complete the
   velocity update with the new forces), bracketed by BEFORE/AFTER_POST_UPDATE hooks.
5. **AFTER_STEP** hooks fire (convergence checks, logging, ...).
6. Convergence is evaluated. Standard dynamics fire **ON_CONVERGE** hooks only
   when systems converge. Fused sub-stages evaluate convergence every step;
   registered hooks run when allowed by `hook.frequency`, receive that
   sub-stage's convergence mask as `ctx.converged_mask`, and must inspect it to
   determine which systems converged. Converged systems in a multi-stage
   pipeline then migrate to the next stage.
7. **ON_GRADUATE** hooks fire, when any are registered and the batch carries a
   `status` column. A system graduates on the step its status reaches
   `exit_status`, whatever changed it, and `ctx.graduated_mask` marks the
   systems that graduated during this step.

`run(batch, n_steps)` calls `step()` in a loop until all systems converge or
`n_steps` is reached. Every hook declares which
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.DynamicsStage` stage it should fire at and at
what frequency, so you have fine-grained control over when callbacks execute.

## Declarative dynamics strategies

{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.strategy.DynamicsStrategy` stores engine
configuration and reconstructible hook specs. For a workflow using one engine,
set `engine` and pass additional constructor arguments in `engine_kwargs`:

```python
from nvalchemi.dynamics import DynamicsStrategy, NVTLangevin

strategy = DynamicsStrategy(
    model=model,
    engine=NVTLangevin,
    engine_kwargs={"dt": 1.0, "temperature": 300.0, "friction": 0.01},
    n_steps=100,
    cache_engine=True,
)
batch = strategy.run(batch)
batch = strategy.run(batch, n_steps=200)
```

The default `build_engine()` supplies `model`, `n_steps`, and `build_hooks()`
to the engine. Keep those three keys out of `engine_kwargs`. `build_hooks()`
returns a new list of `extra_hooks`. Subclasses can override it to add their own
hooks, or override `build_engine()` for workflows with multiple stages, such as
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.mep.NEB`. Without an `engine` or a
`build_engine()` override, construction raises `NotImplementedError` when the
builder is called.

By default, every `run()` builds a fresh engine. With `cache_engine=True`, the
first run builds the engine and later runs reuse its original configuration and
runtime state, including the step counter. A subclass can opt in by declaring
`cache_engine: bool = True`. Calling `build_engine()` directly always constructs
a fresh engine.

`to_spec_dict()` serializes the engine class as an importable dotted path and
hooks as constructor specs. Restore it with
`DynamicsStrategy.from_spec_dict(spec, model=model)`. The live model and cached
engine state are excluded, so a restored strategy starts with an empty cache.

## Using dynamics as a context manager

All dynamics objects (optimizers, integrators, fused stages) support Python's
context manager protocol. The `with` block manages a dedicated
{py:class}`~torch.cuda.Stream` for the simulation and ensures hooks are
properly opened and closed:

```python
from nvalchemi.dynamics import FIRE2, ConvergenceHook

with FIRE2(
    model=model,
    dt=0.05,
    n_steps=500,
    convergence_hook=ConvergenceHook.from_fmax(0.05),
) as opt:
    relaxed = opt.run(batch)
```

When you call `run()` without a `with` block, hook setup and teardown happen
automatically inside `run()`. The context manager form is useful when you need to
call `step()` manually or interleave dynamics with other operations while keeping
hook state (e.g. open log files) alive.

## Multi-stage pipelines with FusedStage

Real workflows often chain multiple simulation phases: relax a structure, then run
MD at increasing temperatures, then relax again. The
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.FusedStage` abstraction lets you compose stages
with the `+` operator:

```python
from nvalchemi.dynamics import FIRE2, NVTLangevin, ConvergenceHook

relax = FIRE2(
    model=model, dt=0.05, n_steps=200, convergence_hook=ConvergenceHook.from_fmax(0.05)
)
md = NVTLangevin(model=model, dt=1.0, temperature=300.0, friction=0.01, n_steps=5000)

pipeline = relax + md
with pipeline:
  pipeline.run(batch)
```

Systems start in the first stage (relaxation). As each system converges, it
automatically migrates to the next stage (MD). Different systems can be in different
stages simultaneously --- the batch is partitioned internally, and a single model
forward pass is shared across all active systems regardless of which stage they
belong to.

### Compiling with `torch.compile`

{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.FusedStage` can compile its entire step function
with `torch.compile` to reduce Python overhead and enable kernel fusion. Call
{py:meth}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.FusedStage.compile` after composing stages:

```python
fused = (relax + md).compile(fullgraph=True)
with fused:
    fused.run(batch)
```

`compile()` wraps the internal `_step_impl` method --- which includes hook dispatch,
masked sub-stage updates, and the shared model forward pass --- in a single compiled
graph. It returns the same instance, so you can chain it fluently.

You can also defer compilation by passing `compile_step=True` at construction time.
In that case, `torch.compile` is invoked lazily when the context manager is entered:

```python
fused = relax + md  # compile_step inherited from sub-stages or set explicitly
with fused:         # compilation happens here
    fused.run(batch)
```

Any keyword arguments accepted by `torch.compile` (e.g. `fullgraph`, `mode`,
`backend`) can be passed to `.compile()` or stored via `compile_kwargs` at
construction.

```{note}
Per-step hooks run inside the compiled `_step_impl` and must be compatible with
`torch.compile`. Hooks that perform Python-side or data-dependent control flow
(e.g. logging, I/O, or `NaNDetectorHook`) introduce graph breaks.
`NeighborListHook` separately calls compiler-disabled helpers. Consequently, these
hooks are not compatible with `fullgraph=True`. Use only torch-compatible per-step
hooks when an unbroken graph is required.

Use `DynamicsStage.ON_ADMISSION` for one-time validation, shape-dependent tensor
allocation, and Python-side setup. `FusedStage` dispatches admission before force
priming and outside compiled `_step_impl`, so this setup does not enter the
steady-state graph.
```

## Distributed pipelines

When a workflow needs more than one GPU --- for example, relaxing structures on one
device and running MD on another --- the
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.DistributedPipeline` distributes stages across
ranks. Where `+` fuses stages onto a single GPU, the `|` operator (or a `stages`
dictionary) assigns one stage per rank and wires up inter-rank communication
automatically.

### Configuring a pipeline

Each rank owns a {py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BaseDynamics` (or
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.FusedStage`) instance. Stages are collected in a
dictionary keyed by global rank and handed to
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.DistributedPipeline`:

```python
from nvalchemi.dynamics import FIRE2, NVTLangevin, DistributedPipeline
from nvalchemi.dynamics.base import BufferConfig

buffer_cfg = BufferConfig(num_systems=4, num_nodes=50, num_edges=0)

stages = {
    0: FIRE2(model=model, buffer_config=buffer_cfg, ...),        # upstream — relaxation
    1: NVTLangevin(model=model, buffer_config=buffer_cfg, ...),  # downstream — MD
}

pipeline = DistributedPipeline(stages=stages, backend="nccl")
with pipeline:
    pipeline.run()
```

By default, `setup()` (called automatically by the context manager) sorts stages by
rank and wires `prior_rank` / `next_rank` between adjacent stages as a simple linear
chain. For more sophisticated topologies --- such as multiple independent
sub-pipelines running in the same job --- set `prior_rank` and `next_rank` explicitly
on each stage:

```python
stages = {
    # Sub-pipeline A: rank 0 → rank 1
    0: FIRE2(model=model, buffer_config=buffer_cfg, prior_rank=None, next_rank=1, ...),
    1: NVTLangevin(model=model, buffer_config=buffer_cfg, prior_rank=0, next_rank=None, ...),
    # Sub-pipeline B: rank 2 → rank 3
    2: FIRE2(model=model, buffer_config=buffer_cfg, prior_rank=None, next_rank=3, ...),
    3: NVTLangevin(model=model, buffer_config=buffer_cfg, prior_rank=2, next_rank=None, ...),
}
```

The first stage in each sub-pipeline typically owns a *sampler* that feeds new
structures into the chain; the last stage owns one or more *data sinks* that collect
converged results.

```{note}
Each rank currently communicates with at most one upstream and one downstream
neighbour (one-to-one topology). Fan-out (one-to-many) and fan-in (many-to-one)
patterns are planned for a future release.
```

### Sizing the buffer

NCCL point-to-point transfers require fixed-size tensors, so each communicating stage
pre-allocates a send buffer and a receive buffer whose dimensions are set by
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BufferConfig`. The three fields control how much
data a single transfer can carry:

| Field | What it controls |
|-------|------------------|
| `num_systems` | Maximum number of graphs (structures) per transfer. Determines throughput per step --- higher values move more data but consume more GPU memory. |
| `num_nodes` | Total atom capacity across all graphs in the buffer. Must be large enough for the worst-case combination of systems. For example, transferring up to 4 structures of at most 50 atoms each requires `num_nodes=200`. |
| `num_edges` | Total edge capacity. Set to **0** when the downstream model recomputes edges via its neighbor list (the common case). Only set a non-zero value if pre-computed edge attributes must be transferred. |

```python
from nvalchemi.dynamics.base import BufferConfig

# 4 structures, up to 200 atoms total, edges recomputed downstream
buffer_cfg = BufferConfig(num_systems=4, num_nodes=200, num_edges=0)
```

When the upstream stage has more converged samples than `num_systems` allows in a
single transfer, the excess stays in the active batch as a no-op until the next
step --- this is the back-pressure mechanism described below.

Atom and edge capacities must accommodate all graphs selected for a transfer.
If the buffer cannot copy every selected graph, the pipeline raises `ValueError`
before removing graphs from the active batch or sending the buffer. Increase the
relevant `BufferConfig` capacities before rerunning.

```{important}
Every pair of communicating stages **must** share an identical
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BufferConfig`.
`DistributedPipeline.setup()` validates this and raises an error on mismatch.
```

### Buffer synchronization

The diagram below shows how two adjacent ranks exchange data through pre-allocated
send and receive buffers during a single step. The upstream rank pushes converged
samples; the downstream rank pulls them into its active batch.

```{graphviz}
:caption: Buffer synchronization between two adjacent ranks in a DistributedPipeline.

digraph buffer_sync {
    rankdir=LR
    compound=true

    subgraph cluster_upstream {
        label="Rank 0  (upstream)"
        style=rounded
        color="#76b900"
        fontcolor="#eeeeee"

        u_batch [label="active_batch"]
        u_send  [label="send_buffer" fillcolor="#4a3315"]
        u_sinks [label="sinks\n(overflow)" style=dashed]

        u_batch -> u_send [label="converged\nsamples" style=bold]
        u_batch -> u_sinks [label="excess\n(back-pressure)" style=dotted]
    }

    subgraph cluster_downstream {
        label="Rank 1  (downstream)"
        style=rounded
        color="#76b900"
        fontcolor="#eeeeee"

        d_recv  [label="recv_buffer" fillcolor="#4a3315"]
        d_batch [label="active_batch"]
        d_sinks [label="sinks\n(results)" style=dashed]

        d_recv -> d_batch [label="incoming\nsamples" style=bold]
        d_batch -> d_sinks [label="converged\nresults" style=bold]
        d_sinks -> d_batch [label="drain when\ncapacity available" style=dotted]
    }

    u_send -> d_recv [
        label="isend / irecv\n(NCCL)";
        style=bold;
        color="#ee9040";
        fontcolor="#eeeeee";
        penwidth=2;
    ]
}
```

A step proceeds as follows:

1. **Pre-step** --- The downstream rank zeros its receive buffer and posts an
   asynchronous `irecv` from its `prior_rank`. In `async_recv` mode (the default),
   the wait is deferred until later in the step; in `sync` mode it blocks
   immediately.
2. **Complete receive** --- The downstream rank waits on the pending receive,
   then routes incoming samples into its active batch (or overflow sinks if the
   batch is full).
3. **Step** --- Both ranks execute their respective integrator or optimizer on their
   active batches.
4. **Post-step** --- The upstream rank identifies converged samples, copies them into
   its send buffer (up to `BufferConfig` capacity), and issues an `isend`. An empty
   buffer is always sent to prevent deadlocks. The final stage routes converged
   samples to its sinks instead.

```{tip}
**Back-pressure**: when the send buffer is full, excess converged samples remain in
the upstream active batch as no-ops until buffer capacity opens up. This naturally
throttles fast producers without dropping data.
```

### Communication modes

The `comm_mode` parameter controls how aggressively communication overlaps with
computation:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `sync` | Blocks on `irecv` immediately in the pre-step. Simplest to debug. |
| `async_recv` *(default)* | Posts `irecv` early, waits only when the data is needed. Overlaps receive with computation. |
| `fully_async` | Also defers `isend` completion to the next step's pre-step. Maximum overlap, highest throughput. |

### Launching

Distributed pipelines are launched with `torchrun` (or any `torch.distributed`
launcher):

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 my_pipeline.py
```

`DistributedPipeline` calls `init_distributed()` on entry and coordinates
termination across ranks via an `all_reduce` on per-rank done flags.

```{seealso}
The {doc}`/examples/distributed/index` gallery contains end-to-end examples,
including multi-pipeline topologies and monitoring with persistent storage.
```

## Structure sources

A run that graduates structures needs fresh ones to take their place, and a run
that starts many trajectories needs them dealt out once.
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.OrderedStructureSampler` is that supply: a
dataset served in row order from one position, `next_row`. The initial batch,
and every later *backfill* (the structures drawn to replace the ones that
finished) read from that position. A structure is therefore propagated once per
pass over the rows, and a sampler restored from its `state_dict()` (`next_row`,
`wraps`, `next_system_id`, `rank`, and `world_size`) picks up where it stopped
rather than at row zero. `shard()` resets the position, so a caller that
re-shards at start-up, as the distillation segment loop does, begins at the
first row of the shard unless it restores the state afterwards.

An *unbudgeted* sampler serves every row it owns as one batch, so that batch
*is* the set of systems the run generates from. A budget --- `max_atoms`,
`max_batch_size`, or `max_edges` --- packs the initial batch first-fit in row
order instead. Packing stops at the first structure that does not fit and leaves
the remainder, in row order, for the backfill. The initial packing and each
backfill are one {py:meth}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.OrderedStructureSampler.draw`
call under a {py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.WithinBudget` policy: the initial
batch with `on_miss="stop"`, and a backfill with `on_miss="skip"`, which passes
over a row that does not fit rather than stalling on it. When you drive `draw`
yourself, `fits=` takes any {py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.FitPolicy`, a
callable over the running atom and edge totals of the batch being drawn.
`max_edges` counts the edges a store saved, not the neighbor list a propagator's
hook rebuilds each step, so set it only when the stored count is the one that
matters.

{py:meth}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.OrderedStructureSampler.shard` narrows the
sampler to the rows one rank owns, dealt strided and unpadded through
{py:func}`~nvalchemi.data.datapipes.distributed_shard`: rank `r` takes every
`world_size`-th row from offset `r`, so the shards are disjoint and cover the
dataset. `recycle=True` wraps the position to the front of the shard when it
reaches the end instead of reporting the sampler exhausted; `wraps` counts how
often that happened, and the `system_id`s keep climbing across a wrap. One
`draw` reaches every row at most once, so a single call never serves two copies
of one structure.

Every batch the sampler hands over is stamped with the bookkeeping an in-flight
run maintains: `status` zeros and consecutive `system_id`s. A store written by an
earlier run, whose exit statuses a propagator would otherwise read as finished,
can therefore be propagated again without a manual cleanup pass. Any object
satisfying the {py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.StructureSource` protocol can
stand in for the sampler; {doc}`/modules/dynamics/api` lists its members.

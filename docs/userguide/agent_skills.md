# Agent Skills

The ALCHEMI Toolkit ships a set of **agent skills** --- concise instruction
files that AI coding assistants (Claude, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) can load to
get up to speed with the `nvalchemi` API without lengthy context-gathering.

Skills live in the repository under `.claude/skills/`.

## Installing skills

**Inside a repository clone** --- nothing to install. Claude Code discovers
`.claude/skills/` automatically; other agents are routed to the right
`SKILL.md` by the table in the repository's `AGENTS.md`.

**Outside a clone** --- copy the skill folders from `.claude/skills/` into
your project's skills directory, or your user-level one (e.g.
`~/.claude/skills/`) if you work with `nvalchemi` across many checkouts.
